Re: Have fun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just a quick note to let you know that I made if to [[L93]] ok. I managed to catch a bad cold before I left, and it has followed me here. I've just been resting the last couple days, and seem to be getting better.

This is a great place to relax though. I'm in the town of Antigua, up in the mountains. It's all cobblestone streets and Mayan vendors selling scarves and blankets. The architecture is really neat. The buildings are very plain on the outside, just stone walls with wooden doors. Inside though, it opens up into big gardened courtyards.

Hopefully, I'll be ready to travel by tomorrow. I think [[L68]] is the next destination.
Livin' Large in the Third World                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 So after a few days holed up in [[L93]], I made it down to [[L68]], and am currently hanging out in [[L5002]]. This place is pretty cool, and it's definitely not been discovered by the tourist industry yet. I've seen six European faces in the two days we've been here. This is a pretty rough town. You don't really get to walk the streets after dark unless you're a local. (especially last night, since the USA just beat the [[L1174]]an soccer team, and the locals were not taking it well!)

We headed up the coast a ways today to check out the surf. I guess the waves had been great the few days before we showed up, but not so much today or yesterday. We managed to find our way onto a nice deserted stretch of black sand beach to try to make some headway on a suntan. Definitely a lot nicer than the trash strewn beach back in town.

Anyway, if the surf doesn't pick up tomorrow, we'll probably head back inland for a while. Maybe into [[L100]] to check out the ruins at [[L5003]].
The Killing Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Today I held a human skull in my hands.

The killing [[L5252]]s are really something to behold.  The site itself is nothing special.  Just a small monument in a [[L5252]] full of holes, but what it lacks in scope it makes up in impact.  The monument itself is essentially a giant glass display case.  10 shelves, 20 feet by 20 feet, each stacked three high with piles of skulls that they have been digging up in the immediate vicinity.  8000 in all.

Walking among the mass graves, it took a while to register the scraps of cloth sticking out of the ground.  This is Southeast Asia so you get used to trash everywhere.  But eventually it sunk in that these were people’s clothes working their way out of the ground after the fall rains.  Scratch the surface and you’ll find bones inside them.  Visitors collect them in little shrines along with teeth and bits of clothing.  The sign says there are 2000 more bodies that they plan to leave buried there.  As I said, it’s a pretty powerful experience.
Southeast Asian Travel Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Woke up in time for a nice cup of coffee on the lake in [[L5046]] and a few minutes to chill before another long travel day.

So, a half hour on a motorbike across town and an hour on a state of the art Cambodian airliner puts me back in lovely [[L5097]] in time to pick up the bags and jump on a night train to [[L1739]] Thani.  Just 20 hours of buses, pickup trucks and longtail boats away from the beach.  No worries!
Angkor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Angkor is pretty cool.  I'm digging the part where they let you climb over basically anything.  The best temples are the broken down ones in the jungle where you can clambor over big piles of stone blocks and drop squeeze into the old Temples that are barely standing.

It was nice that you could hire a guy for $5 to drive you around on a motorbike from [[L3190]] to sunset and wait outside these temple sites for hours at a time, but still I think my best day was the one where I just rented a bike and pedaled out to the remote spots that nobody visits.  Got to meet a couple kids on their way to the fishing hole, and found the back way through the jungle to get from temple to temple.

Too bad they're building giant luxury hotels so fast.  In another year or so I bet you'll start seeing ropes and signs and guards all over the place.  Better get there now if you still want to sift through the rubble yourself!
A month later...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Been here a whole month now, climbing rocks, working on the tan, and amassing stories.  Maybe if I get some time I'll even tell some of them.  Until then, know that life remains good.
Tidal Wave                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      So [[L215]] is treating me pretty well thus far. Beautiful weather, great beach, clear water, perfect rock, couldn't ask for much more. 

So check out the first photo on this page:

http://www.megagrip.co.uk/[[L215]]/Thai7.htm

That is the route that I'm working on at the moment. The photo doesn't do justice to how ridiculously steep this piece of rock is. There is a 20 
foot section where you gain 3 feet of elevation! Completely unlike anything I've been on. It's all sorts of fun, and plenty hard as well. I've put three days into it so far, and only just this morning finally got to see the top. That doesn't mean I'm done by any means. Now I get to spend the next few days linking together moves and trying to get the whole thing in one go.

Anyway, things go well. Plenty to climb, plenty of time relaxing on the beach, even some diving in the cards. See ya! 
The King Cruiser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                So life in [[L3322]] continues to be nothing but good. I made it out diving the other day, and it was the best I've ever seen. Ridiculous amounts of fish, anenomae and assorted critters. You'd lose sight of your dive buddy because there'd be 15,000 young barracuda in the way.

Our first dive of the day was on this passenger ferry that sank a few years back. The main deck is like 24m down and it's upright and in good condition. It's fun and a bit spooky cruising around inside the thing, as all the divers stir up the water &amp; visibility is reduced to just a few meters. Being a boat, it has plenty of narrow doors and confined spaces to swim through. Definitely a cool experience!

And for those of you keeping score, I've put in a total of six days on the route now. Only a couple burns a day recently, since I have all the moves wired now, and I'm just trying to put together a clean ascent. I can get it with one rest along the way now. Now I'm just moving that rest spot gradually downward until I can cast off straight from the sand.

The route will have to wait a bit though, as I'm off to the islands tomorrow, followed by a dash for the malaysian border so that I can get a fresh 
30 day visa. 
Re: Hawaii                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      So they have cats all over the place here. They are somewhat wild, though aparently you can claim one as your own by putting a collar around its neck. As far as I can tell, most of them are filling in the duty normally performed by pidgeons. They'll hang out next to you at the restaurant and wait for you to drop some rice.

They have all sorts of chickens and ducks running around too. In fact everything on the menu is present and accounted for except beef. That sort of sets the mind wondering as to the true purpose of all those cats...

Anyway, we set off traveling tomorrow, so hopefully I'll have more interesting stories to report. 
Re: g-e-t-l-i-v-e                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               So Jay seems to be a step or two farther from the grave. In fact, he'll be climbing this afternoon, and all I can do is belay. I seem to have hosed up my shoulder, so anything I do with my left arm is somewhat agonizing. Maybe more chillin' will help.

And you'll be happy to know that I've been downing every sketchy looking dish that the street vendors can toss my way. I've even been drinking the local hootch with buckets of poisonous ice from the bar. I'm indestructable! 

(Notes: 1. Jay did in fact not die of the intestinal disorder that had him sidlined for most of the trip. 2. The shoulder complaints mentioned here were likely a mild case of the bends. )
Re: life philosophies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Life remains unpredictable for me these days. I'm actually in [[L5097]] now, holding a ticket to Bali for tomorrow morning. It occured to me that I since I have another climber friend enroute to krabi in a couple weeks, I would need to strike now if I had any desire to go see non-thailand things. [[L156]] was the first candidate, followed by chaing mai. Then I stumbled across a cheap fare to Densapur, and it got me thinking about surfing.

This works out well for our kid Jay, as his body hasn't reacted well to tropical environs and poor sanitation. As weeks of never quite being healthy enough to climb piled up, he's been talking more about rafting, snowboarding, and other things you can do in sub-95% humidity. He hopped a flight back to the states this morning. 
back across the equator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Do you have any idea how cheap a flight to Bali is when you book it in [[L5097]]? Well I do now, and I'm loving it here. All I knew was that there's surfing to be had in [[L104]], and that was pretty much enough. Indeed there is, as I found out first hand today. There is also really good food, friendly people, sun and remarkably cheap accomodation.

In fact, everything is pretty cheap here. They actually have paper money that is worth less than a penny. You give the guy on the beach the equivilant of a two dollar bill to pay for a bottle of water, and he has to scramble among his friends to break it for you. 

So I'm pretty much [[L5097]]'d out by now. It's a great place to visit for a day or two on the way to somewhere. But I've done that three times now on this trip alone, and there's really not all that much to do. They've got temples, they've got crowds, they've got people selling you fried, barbequed, and otherwise dead things to eat, but that's about it. About the only amusement I have left is playing &quot;is that prostitute a man?&quot; at night. She usually is. 
Re: back across the equator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (clarifying the [[L5097]] lady-boy remarks from the previous report...)

I generally try not to actually engage them in conversation. You can usually tell from a distance, though some do a really good job of looking the part! 

Bali has some truly amazing waves that I have no intention of paddling out to anytime in the near future. I spent part of today day at Ulu Watu when it wasn't even on, and it looked plenty mean. There's rock here, by the way. I'm going to do some scoping over the next week to see if we should be planning a future expedition w/ Hilti in tow. There's definately enough bouldering on the beach to keep a fella occupied for a while. 
Merry Christmas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Good to hear from you. I was getting a bit homesick as the big holiday approached. It turns out I had a pretty good time down here though. Xmas eve was spent with fellow travelers and Islanders eating curry in this festively decorated little restaurant with Indonesian christmas carrols in the background. Selamet nasi goreng and a happy new year!

So it turns out that my buddy Jay doesn't function all that well in the tropics. The five weeks he was in [[L215]], he was never quite healthy, wavering back and forth between a stomach bug and some sort of bronchial thing. It worked out great for me, because he was always healthy enough to belay me on climbs, yet he could usually be counted on to eat less than his share at mealtimes. The perfect traveling companion as far as I'm concerned, but somehow he didn't see it that way.

Anyway, I'll be embarking on an informal tour of Bali and the surrounding islands tomorrow. It should be fun, I managed to get down the coast a ways today and It was quite a bit nicer than around town. Happy holidays! 
Re: Back in Thailand yet?

Uhhh... Bali is sort of in [[L104]]. They seem to like americans just fine so far, though I guess they bombed a church or two over on Lombok the other day. That's the next island to the right from Bali. 

I spent a few days on Nusa Lembongan, a tiny island off the coast. It was just beautiful. I had this dream bungalow on the second story fronting the beach, looking over the lagoon and out to the reef where they have a great surf break. Pretty much the primo room on the whole island. Two bucks a night.

Yeah, the whole thing where they kill all the foreigners is doing great things for the exchange rate over here. And realisticly, it would take quite a while to kill them all. I think I'll last at least another week!

Well, happy new years! Keep me posted about the dot com situation. Maybe I'll just have to stay over here until the market improves!

I spent an afternoon bouldering at one of the local surf breaks and getting strange reactions from the locals. I guess nobody had ever climbed there before. I'll be renting a motorbike and doing some exploring over the next few days. There seems to be some good potential. 
Bangkok or Bust!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                {{DSCF0091.jpg|left}} Hello... This is the two of us outside of Terminal four at Heathrow.  We were both tentatively excited about the pending trip and even though it is early days we can scrap tentatively from that phrase.

After the very long flight, on which sleepy head Tim managed to sleep through the most of, we were struck by the heat at [[L5097]]'s airport. Temperatures out here are in the mid to late 30's, so the first couple of days have been a bit tiring but nonetheless worth every second, even if i needed help with my backpack from Tim!

Currently we are more used to the climate, and shall be getting our first taste of the rainy season very soon! The 5th May is the King's coronation and so it is considered a bank holiday, particularly as this year is his 60th anniversay. The next photo is of one of the many Buddha images that are being renovated/polished up ready for the Kings Birthday in June! and check out the &quot;Chillin&quot; buddha (actually know as the Reclining Buddha at Wat Pho).
{{DSCF0099.jpg|center}}{{DSCF0092.jpg|right}}

Well time is short and we are both safe and well, and most certainly having the time of our lives out here! So until next time, take care! Dont forget you can post your own messages here too!

Love from us!

We are writing this nearly a weeek later because we were staying on the river Kwai and Internet access was practically non-existant.  Obviously we did not stay on the bridge over the river Kwai but this is what it looks like today.
{{762|center}}.  Later that day as we arrived in [[L5293]] we went on the railway, and had a walk through a rainforest the emphasis was definately on the RAIN!!

During our time in Kanchanburi we managed to fit in; a few museums. caving, bamboo rafting, elephant riding, waterfalls, and a lot of treks!  Check out our photo album under our profile for more photo's. Oh, and we also visited a Buddhist Tiger Temple.  The Buddhists are not the guys in blue!

With [[L5293]] done, al we had to do was get south, which as you will read is easier said than done.
Time to Dive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We left Kanchanburi at 2.30pm on Wednesday, this was a straightoforward minibus back to [[L5097]] which took 3 hours.  Our VIP coach arrived at 7.15pm, but unfortunately it was overbooked, we ended up perching on a bench for 8 hours, which was superior to the alternative offered which was sleeping behind the back seats on the floor!  We arrived at the boat harbour at 3.15, and had to wait until the boat left which turned out to be around four hours later.  After no sleep we were looking forward to resting on the boat but the air conditioning was set to &quot;freeze&quot; and even though outside was warmer, it was blowing a storm.  By the time we arrived at Koh Tao, which is a few hours north of Koh Samui, at 10.30 in the morning we were dispirited to say the least, and not exactly sure what to expect.  Well these two photo's will let you know why we've travelled this far, and why at the end of it all we have absolutely no complaints.

We are going to start our 4 day diving course on Saturday in and around the very waters pictured above.  We will let you know how that one goes, but we have got to go and do some studying for now.  All the best. Tim.
Gulf of Thailand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hello everyone! 

Its been a while since we last updated the website, as the gulf is so much more expensive than in Bankgkok or the north so time spent on the internet was mainly used for emails! First off on a good note, Tim successfully completed his diving course which he can use internationally to further his experience diving! unfortunately i was unable to complete the course as my sinuses with hayfever was causing me trouble with my breathing underwater and i could not use my nose to clear my mask of water. i have been referred however and i can carry on the course anywhere else, as long as my sinuses are clear, however this isnt going to happen anytime soon, so we left koh tao as planned on the 16th May to arrive on [[L5294]] to a beutiful beach bungalow with fantastic views of Lamai Beach. {{DSCF0152.jpg|center}}
we checked out the sights and places to eat and found ourselves a great little roadside diner - Ninja Crepes......and oh my god, they do the best food ever and were brilliant hosts! we ended up eating here for breakfast lunch and dinner!

A funny sight on [[L5294]] which is often frequented by tourists and locals are the two rock formations that lie south of Lamai Beach. They are supposed to represent the spirits of a couple that lost their lives to the sea and so their spirits took to shapes in the rocks, tims photo next to the lady spirit (for want of a better or rather the more obvious word!!!) is one of the best!{{DSCF0154.jpg|left}} the rock in my photo is not so impressive!!!!!{{DSCF0155.jpg|right}}

Feeling Krabi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   [[L5279]], another eventful journey to get to, but again soooooo worth every moment. This time our travels involved the taxi to the port on [[L5294]], then a boat to mainland, from here a bus with a random stop in the middle of an unknown town, our mission we were informed was to find the agency who issued our bus tickets to our bunglalow resort to get the ticket changed to one that was apparantly more aceeptable than the one we had - this turned out to be a piece of paper with writing stating the time of the bus we needed, and the fact that the ticket was for the two of us. That was it, our ticket. 

This eventually got us an to a bus, which inceidentally was the same bus that some people before our stop in the random town had gotten onto a couple hours earlier! Grrrr! Anyway we arrived at the wrong bus station ;o) and was picked up by a taxi from Fasai Resort - they are a cool bunch of people! wacky, funny and sweet, and they threw us a great BBQ on our last night as a lot of people just like us were leaving after a long stay.
{{DSCF0158.jpg|center}}
The weather was not so cool during our stay in [[L5279]], but still the people and the scenery was as beautiful as ever, with scary limestone rock formations everywhere you went! but it was nice to be out of the main strips where most tourists and backpackers are!{{DSCF0163.jpg|center}}
Phi Phi Dreams!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Still on the Andaman Sea, we arrived on Phi Phi Island ( Tuesday 23rd May) just after midday, and wow, it was beautiful; following the storms of [[L5279]], this was a pleasant arrival to the most stunning beaches we have experienced in [[L215]] so far! 

Phi Phi was the island famously devasted by the tsunami, and though much work still needs to be done, it has rebuilt a solid basic infrastructure that allows you enjoy Phi Phi at its best! The viewpoint photos just say it all, and when you see the island from that point, it is not difficult to see why it was so devasted by the waves.

First Inspiration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I first got the idea to build this thing back in the summer of 2005, sitting in the coffee shop at Powell's books in Portland, thumbing through a Lonely Planet book on travel writing.  My dreams of a comfortable life as a traveling author were abruptly dashed, but I came across a term that the author had used that stuck with me.  Blog-a-bond.

{{990|right}}I downed the rest of my coffee and headed to the nearest Starbucks to register the domain.  (Yes, it may sound silly to most of you that I would drink coffee in one coffee shop and use another one only for its wireless internet access.  But if you're from Portland, you'll understand.  Coffee is important.)  Anyway, I had the domain even before I knew what I would build.  I figured I'd probably throw up a set of tools that the average Joe could use to build something like I had going at http://www.jasonkester.com/ .  Still, I was in no hurry to go ahead with anything.  I just liked the name.
The Flaky VC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So now it's two days later and I'm scanning for consulting gigs on Craigslist in LA.  I've been sort of living in Pasadena for a while, trying to get Expat Software ( http://www.expatsoftware.com/ ) to the point where I can skip the country again with a full load of work.  
 
{{991|right}}There's an overly enthusiastic ad from a guy wanting to build a MySpace clone, so I send off an overly enthusiastic response asking for more info.  It turns out he wants to build a travel site, with maps and itineraries and community spaces and a huge database of everything in the world that a traveler might want to know.  It was actually a pretty cool concept, but it had one fatal flaw.  It would have taken an army of data-entry monkeys a year to compile enough information on cool places and sights to make it a worthwhile place for a traveler to hang out and do research.  
 
The one thing that I brought away from the 2 weeks of proposal writing to this increasingly flaky prospect was a heads up on the existence of the Google Maps API.  Holy Crap!  That's Cool!  I'm gonna build this guy a couple prototypes!
 
I ended up writing the seed that would eventually sprout into the Trip Builder.  Naturally, the money never showed up and the flaky VC evaporated, but now I was inspired enough to keep going.  I figured if the guy ever came back, I'd offer to cut him in on the action (though I'm still convinced there never will be any profit from this thing), and until then I'd just take this on as a hobby, building the site that I wish I'd found back when I was building http://www.jasonkester.com/ .
Usability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Things have been moving fast these last few days.  We finally pushed our first build live on Saturday, and have been getting lots of good usability feedback.  

Lesson One: Nobody Reads Instructions!
This was our first real mistake.  Our screens were easy enough to use, but you really needed to read the little block of text up top to know what you were supposed to do.  Even the fact that the &quot;Countries In View&quot; list next to the map could be scrolled off the screen caused a few users to wonder why they couldn't pick [[L215]] off the list when they were zoomed in on Central America.

Lucky for us, the changes we needed to make were pretty minor.  The big explanatory paragraphs are all either gone, or moved down out of the way, in favor of big simple taglines.  Gone are the references to Travel Journals, Trip Reports and Diaries.  Now it's all Travel Blogs and Blog entries.

Lesson Two: If it looks clickable, it better work!
We have big ideas here.  There are plenty of new features on the way, so we mock up all our screens to incorporate those features.  The only problem is that users see a link saying &quot;0 photos&quot;, and expect to be able to click on it to get to the page where they can view those zero photos.  It never would have occurred to me to do that!

So this was another easy fix.  We went through and lopped off anything that's not fully built.  And in a few cases, we just cranked overnight and made those features work.  So now, if you click on something, you can be assured you'll go somewhere.
Are there really Mexican cities in Africa?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We're using a latitude/longitude database put together by the US government.  It has over 2 million populated places in it, and for the most part it's fairly accurate. But not always.  During testing, I kept seeing cities showing up in places they really didn't belong.  And strange things, like [[L74]] showing up as 'in view' no matter where in the world we were looking.

Digging around in the data, I managed to find a dozen or so mistakes, usually where a longitude of -97.115 would end up as 97.115 or 9.7115.  Luckily, most were tiny villages that could simply be plucked off the map and never missed.  We also had to deal with countries like [[L191]], which are far enough North that they actually span most of the globe.

Anyway, most of it is fixed now.  Though just yesterday I got an email wondering why 'Centering' on [[L172]] would show you a blowup of the Indian Ocean.  Slowly, slowly, it's all starting to come together.
Forums go live                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Cranking out features like this and like that!  Forums went live today, and they've exploded with a whopping ONE post to date.  Yeah!  Taking the world by storm!

Photos are also getting easier to manage by the day.  With luck, we'll have Tagging in place for photos and comments soon.  For now though I'm having to deal with silly things like making the site &quot;search engine friendly&quot;, and other minor technical details that keep me away from actually making the site better.

There's also a new design on the way.  Sad news I know for those of you in love with grey boxes and oversized fonts.  But we live in a visual world, my friends.  And looking at the competition it is clear that we simply cannot hang unless we clean the look up a bit.
More wackiness in the City data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [[L5121]] is not in the database.  As in, the capital city of the UAE, probably a city we need.  I've noticed a few other standouts that just aren't there in other places too.  This is not good.

We're really going to need a way for users to add their own locations to the map.  And while we're at it, we should probably add the concept of aliases for places we know about.  The town of [[L5029]] shows up right in the center of [[L5121]] if you zoom in on the map.  It would be nice if our application knew they were the same place.

But wait, it gets worse!  [[L5109]] and Alexandria are missing too.  The tiny oasis of [[L5161]] is there, but the two largest cities in the country are just plain gone.  Not acceptable.  We're going to have to find a better dataset.

Oh yeah, I can zoom into my hotel in [[L5109]] and see the name of the neighborhood.  But the city is not there.  And it claims that [[L111]], [[L191]] and the [[L196]] are in view!

Ah ha!  Turns out in my initial import, I neglected to include capital cities!
By travelers, for travelers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     {{992|center}}
&quot;By travelers, for travelers.&quot;

You'll find this claim on just about every travel site out there, but if you dig around you'll also probably find a mailing address in [[L3080]] or some other non-exotic location.  There's an office there, staffed with anywhere between a half dozen and a few hundred people, most of whom have never been outside the [[L233]].  This is not unexpected, since any place that actually hired dirtbag travelers as its staff would have such high turnover that it would never get anything done.

With Blogabond.com, I'm hoping to make that &quot;by travelers&quot; claim a reality.  As I write this, I'm sitting at a guesthouse off Khoa San road in [[L5097]], nursing a Beer Chang and working out the details on how not to get my laptop stolen when I head out to [[L39]] tomorrow.  I'll be on the road for the better part of a year this time around, and with luck I'll find enough time to work this site into presentable shape by the time I'm done.

I just pushed a new build live that addresses a few minor bug fixes and finally adds the ability to comment on other people's trip reports.  In the next few weeks, you can expect to see enhancements to make the Maps a bit more usable, and a new, more elegant design.  So if you're a big fan off grey boxes and photos of cows, best speak up now because they will soon be a thing of the past!
Blogabond Global Headquarters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {{995|left}}I spent the winter of 2005/2006 on Tonsai Beach in southern [[L215]].  I seem to spend about every other winter in [[L215]], climbing rocks on the beach.  It's just that good.  This time around I had some client work to keep me busy part time, and with the laptop along it was easy enough to spend the odd afternoon geeking out on Blogabond.

The site had been live for about 3 months at this point, and was finally starting to attract a few actual users.  I'd been intentionally keeping a low profile, and letting people find the place on their own.  As Joel (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) says, &quot;when you get premature publicity, lots of people check out your thing, and it's not done yet, so now most of the people that tried your thing think it's lame, and now you have two problems: your thing is lame and everybody knows it.&quot;

{{994|right}}So, with a few Real People using the thing, I was able to get some feedback about why Real People think that Blogabond sucks.  I've since fixed a lot of those things, and will hopefully get around to fixing more of them soon.  For now though, there's this climbing route on the beach called Tyrolean Air that's been taking up a bunch of my time.  It will be my first 7c, and I keep taking 20 foot falls from the endurance section above the crux.  Sometimes, work has to take a back seat…
The Australian Mobile Office                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Believe it or not, if you spend enough time sipping Mai Tais on a tropical beach, you will eventually get bored of it.  After 4 months in [[L215]], I was ready for a change.  How about a last minute, 60 day return ticket to [[L12]]?  I hear they've got surf there.

So, with the promise of another couple weeks client work (for real money), I booked a crazy plush holiday flat in [[L5007]] for myself and the lovely miss Helen.  Bought some surfboards, wrote some code, surfed a bunch, lived large.  Bought a cheap van off an English chick, threw a bit more money at it so that it might actually run, and headed South in search of right point breaks and wireless hotspots named Linksys and Default.

{{996|right}}A few new features kept creeping into the site.  Somewhere along the way, Tags were born, browsing and search were improved, and the map stopped zooming out to see the entire planet just because you started your trip halfway around the world from where you were actually writing reports.  Internet access is actually hard to come across in [[L12]], so updates would pile up for a while before being thrown live with crossed fingers.  

Once we made it to [[L1031]], the surfboards got stashed in the back and the climbing gear came back out.  Spent a week in the Blue Mountains and another at [[L5329]], clipping bolts with friends met in [[L215]].  Finally, we limped the van down to Melbourne and passed it off to a friend, who managed to get it halfway back across town before it died a painful death in the middle of rush hour traffic.  
Non-Stop                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        According to the rulebook, every travel blog needs at least one Travel Horror Story, so here's a quick rundown of our return flight to England.

Well, first off, we didn't actually have tickets to England.  Just a return flight from Melbourne to [[L5097]] via Singapore.  So that's 11 hours plus 7 hours for those of you keeping score.  Once in BKK, we cleared customs with all our gear and a surfboard, and proceeded to try to book the rest of our trip home.  According to every travel agent we'd talked to in [[L12]], &quot;There is no such thing as standby anymore.&quot;  &quot;You need to have a confirmed reservation from a travel agent to board a flight.&quot;  That's not actually the case, but good on ya, travel agents, for trying to sell us a full-fare last minute ticket!

We ended up with a sketchy, over-padded, wait-listed itinerary onward to Birmingham, with nothing more than a handwritten credit card receipt in Thai Baht to keep us from being booted onto the street in [[L2298]].  I guess the nice thing about post 9/11 travel is that if you somehow manage to get a standby ticket, you'll be the only one on the waiting list.  The desk in [[L2298]] had no idea what to do with us, so they just stuck on a plane and had us stand around until a couple seats freed up.

So, add in another two flights at 14 hours and 2 hours, followed by another customs line with a surfboard and a 4 hour drive to Wales.  That leaves us awake for a little over two days altogether, which may not be a record or anything, but it's not bad considering that this blog is supposed to be about writing software.
Photos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I've been thinking a lot about photos recently because, frankly, it's not that easy to upload and manipulate photos on Blogabond right now.  It's certainly doable, and not much of a chore if you just want to upload and tag a half dozen shots for a Blog entry.  But, as users have been mentioning with increasing frequency lately, it's really time consuming to dump all 500 shots from your memory card onto the site.

That, in my mind, is a good thing.

While it's true that we offer unlimited photo storage for free, we do so with the [[L5247]] that our users will limit themselves to only posting the best photos that they have, and the ones that best compliment the journal entries that they write.  The theory is that since it takes a bit of time to get a photo up and viewable, our users will be a bit more selective with the pictures they choose to share.  At least, more so than they might be if we made it easy to dump the 4GB memory card from a digital camera straight onto the site.

At the end of the day, there are plenty of good sites on the web that offer free photo storage.  And realistically, anybody using Blogabond.com simply as a place to store and view their photos would probably better served moving over to Flickr.  I think of Blogabond as something like a cocktail party.  Just a bunch of friends sitting around, telling their travel stories and showing off some cool photos.  The last thing you really want at a party like that is somebody setting up the slide projector and running through all 4000 photos of his trip to [[L176]].  It's all about selectivity, and I think that making it just a little bit difficult to set up that projector might turn out to be a good thing.
Connectivity at last!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Internet has not yet made it to England.

This is what I've discovered over the last month, trying in vain to find a place to plug in my laptop around [[L5330]], a pretty big town up in the Lakes.  Unlike any remote corner of [[L240]], where you'll find three internet cafes in a little village with no tourism, mighty first world England has virtually no place to plug in.  You can find a smoky pub with wi-fi, but try to connect to it and you'll hit the hopelessly broken signup mechanism that shells you out to an ISP to purchase time online, then blocks the page where you'd give your credit card details.  Not that I'm all that excited to spend &#163;60 for a month of access in the first place, but the process of doing so should not be this painful.

{{993|right}}But now, things are looking up.  I'm in Chamonix now, kicking it at a giant ski chalet, gearing up for a couple months of client work. With luck, maybe I'll have a few hours here and there to play around on Blogabond.  But for the most part, I'll be heads down alongside the rest of the Expat Software team, building The Next Big Thing for our client.

I'm liking the idea of offshore development with a strong team imported from back home.  We've done collaborative things remotely in the past, with good results, but this is the first time we've tried to bring the entire team onsite.  Even the client is coming out for the duration of the project, so we'll eliminate the communication gap that often slows down remote development.  It's also cool that we're halfway around the world from the distractions that usually get in the way of productivity.  With the whole team snowed into the chalet, there's nothing to do but crank out code.  It should be good.
Starting it up and driving it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I started the engine for the first time.
{{997|center}}

Still had a few touches before I could drive it.  I found a middle seat from a van at a junkyard.  Diane and I recovered it with an Indian blanket.  
{{998|center}}  

I finished the body work on the hood and put it in place.  Also, I ordered a windshield and put it in just in time to take it to its first car show.  {{1001|center}}

Looking good.

You all can say you knew me when…                                                                                                                                                                                                                               {{1026|center}}

Ideally, there would also be a cheap place to crash nearby (without camping), but that is secondary.

Can anybody help me out? 
Hey!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            {{1203|left}}I wasn't sure that I'd be able to send e-mail whilst on the road, but aparently it's not too much of a problem in the bigger cities. I'm in [[L2616]] now at this cybercafe thing in the trendy section of town. It costs 500 pasetas (around $5) for an hour on this ald beater computer.

So far, everything is going great. I met up with my friend Laura (climbing paul's landlord) and we headed down to [[L149]] for a few days. It is a totally cool place, and everything you hear about everybody trying to screw you out of your money is true. You get off the boat in Tangiers and are immediately mobbed by all these 'guides'. 

{{1205|right}}We escaped the first round only to find that one had appointed himself our guide and was walking in front of us the whole time. Anyway, we escaped to [[L5351]], 50 miles south on the atlantic coast, and it was beyond cool. Everybody was friendly, and the sun was out and the beach was sandy, and the food was incredible. Go to a morroccan restuarant tonight and get yourself some meatball Tajine and a loaf of bread to go with it.

Anyway, I dropped Laura off at the airport this morning, and tonight I'll hop a night train through barcelona and connect on to Marseilles or Nice. It turns out that the best climbing areas are all within a couple hundred miles of marseiles. After a few days on the beach, I need to pull on some rock.

Anyway, [[L205]] pretty much rules, as does [[L149]] (and moroccan food). I'm pretty much fed up with big cities, and the french in general, so I'm off to climb some rocks.

I'm sure I'll be more poetic in my next email, but for now I'm just mostly beat and looking at 20 hours on the train to Marseilles, so I need to go buy a bunch of that $1 wine to ease the journey. 
Mo' of da trip                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  {{1199|right}}So phase two of the trip took me to Buoux, this little town in the s. of [[L79]] with big rocks and a cheap campground. It's takng a while to get calibrated to this overhanging pocketed limestone, but for the most part, climbing is going well. All the english speaking climbers bailed simultaneously a couple days ago, so I headed south to marseilles in search of a sunburn.

Found it, and now I'm off to ceuse to [[L5280]] up with a guy with a car and climb those 900 foot walls at verdon. So far, Kester's trip is going just fine...

So yeah, I'm in [[L1666]] now, chillin at the Garner estate. I spent a week at Ceuse, which is possibly the best rock in europe. Moderately to way overhanging with big giant holds. You lose perspective for which way is up standing next to these walls because they are so uniformly overhanging. Everything looks straight up and down, yet the rope hits the ground 20 feet out from the base. The approach is an entire hour of walking up hill, and you gain like 1800 feet of elevation. You can watch planes flying around between you and the compground.

I'll spend a few days here and then go see about climbing some more stuff. July 7 is the day to remember as far as running with the bulls is concerned. I'll keep you posted as to whether I survive.

I got a 1 hang onsight (I dont think that's a term, but you get the picture) on this 7a+ (.12a) that I'll have to go redpoint when I get back to ceuse. [[L5350]] rules as well, by the way. It's a 45 minute drive, but if you leave the campground at the same time, you're climbing at the same time as you would be at ceuse, but much more rested. It's mongosso steep, with huge holds for the most part, and z-clippable bolts. &quot;A rezt day for zee mind&quot;, as the austrians say. I usually tag #'s 1, 3 &amp; 5 on redpoints. I onsighted a 6c+ (.11c), and have this 7b+ (.12c) down to two hangs.

As far as festive festivals go, this one was pretty damn festive. First of all, you have no option but to party until dawn, as there is nowhere to sleep even if you wanted to. A typical day starts at 5pm with dinner and a bullfight. Then 12 hours of swilling sangria &amp; calimotxo (cheap red wine &amp; coke) with a few thousand wassailers in the street, then a quick run with some bulls to cap off the evening at 8am, and off to the park to sleep.

I'm now in barcelona recuperating, and I've got to say that I've never appreciated a bed quite as much as I do now.

Anyway, rockclimbing season starts back up tomorrow or so, so It will probably be a few weeks before I can check my mail again. 
Re: Jump from a sree finger pocket - right hand                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yeah, it pretty much rules here. I think I'm better too. At least I've finally figured out how to work a route effectively. I got this 7b (.12b) on my 2nd redpoint attempt after an hour long session of working the thing on lead.

Oh yeah, I took BIG WHIPPER number two the other day, at the hands of the same belayer chick from BW1. This time I was 5 feet above a bolt &amp; 15 feet right resting on a ledge (and enjoying a giant sport loop) when I pulled off a hold. Moral: [[L5350]] rules, just dont eat your lunch below the cliff if you dont want to get clobbered by falling rocks. Oh, and dont worry, the french will probably bolt the hold back on.

I spent the last month camped out in this farmer's [[L5252]] in [[L5349]], climbing at Ceuse and [[L5350]]. Now I'm in [[L1590]] preparing to reintegrate into society.

Random french trivia:

They have Pier 1 Imports here, but it's just called Pier Imports. They actually leave enough room in the sign for the 1, but it's nowhere to be found. I think they use them as American traps, because you stare at this sign across the street trying to figure out if the 1 is just burned out or what, and after about a block of walking and staring, they have this open manhole for you to trip over and fall into. At least that was my experience.

Anyway, I'm in [[L1590]] now and I fly out the 11th. I'll make my way to london in a couple days.

I'm actually looking forward to being back in america. I miss 8 lane roads and big supermarkets and signs that point to things that actually exist and stores that are open at 9 at night and 1 in the afternoon and at all on sunday and monday. So I'll try to make it up to [[L3481]] soon after I get back.

&gt; I need any type of info for Ceuse. Easy to find partner? camping? How
&gt; far from Gap? thanks

I spent a little over a month there off and on last summer. I would highly recommend the place. Partners are always easy to find, and most of the people even speak english.

The crux can be hitching from Gap. I had times where I was picked up within 30 seconds of sticking my thumb out, and at least one 8-hour ordeal to get the 25km up to [[L5349]]. From downtown, walk out a ways on the D994. Scribble out a sign that says &quot;Freisineusse(sp?)&quot; as well as &quot;[[L5349]]&quot;. That should inspire the through traffic to at least take you partway. Anyway, at Fres..., head left on the D47 and follow the signs to [[L5349]]. Hopefully by now you're in a car with a climber. Otherwise, walk the mile uphill from [[L5349]] to Les Guerins campground.

Les Guerins is a turbo plush campground by US standards. It has free hot showers, refrigerators, washing machine, and a woody in the barn for rainy days. Not bad for 3 bucks a night. Gerard, the farmer that owns the place doesn't speak any english, so it's always fun trying to pay for camping. He also sells bread and chalk, as well as really cheap ravioli.

According to the french, Ceuse is the place to be is southern [[L79]] when the weather is too hot at Buoux and elsewhere. I was there from June to [[L5910]] and there were always plenty of people to climb with and bum rides into town from. 
Heading North                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   [[L5201]] was our last Island in the South of [[L215]], and the start of our trip North, we stayed ata really nice place on Karon Beach for two days where we saw one of the most beautiful sunsets seen since we have been away.
{{DSCF0188.jpg|center}}
 
We then left [[L5201]] for [[L5097]] by plane, which was easy enough except our flght time had changed and nobody had bothered to inform us! As a result of this, we had three hours to kill which just happened to be enough time to grab a Burger King! It tasted so much better because we knew it was sooooo bad!
We were only in [[L5097]] for 12 hours as our first train heading North to Ayutthaya was at 8am and we had to pick up our visas before we left.

{{DSCF0201.jpg|right}}So visas, sorted, train journey all good, we arrived into Ayutthaya, the former capital of [[L215]] and saw the first of many Khmer temple ruins.

{{DSCF0212.jpg|left}}Followed by more ruins at [[L5313]] - another ex-capital - here we spent two nights enjoying the ruins and the town on our bikes!

We really enjoyed the south for its people and beautiful scenery especially the beaches in [[L5201]], and Phi Phi Island! These two islands, especially the latter were hit hardest by the tsunami and you can still see the devestation, but it is amazing to think that it has taken so little time, to get the basics back to 'normal'.

The north has been equally amazing, more for its mountains, and plains in the central part of the country, and particularly for its fantastic temple ruins seen in the old cities of Sukhotai and Ayuthuya{{1003|right}}
Whilst based in [[L2633]] we took a trek to see a hill tribe in the mountains, where we saw scenery like this:  

The trek was only for 2 days and 1 night but this photograph was taken near the end of the trekking part of the trip.  I think body language experts can tell you exactly what we are feeling right here.{{1008|center}}

The day after the trek we got our first Thai Massage and enjoyed a traditional meal with Thai entertainment.  Unfortunately the camera did not capture the entertainment very well as it was at night, but take our word for it and believe that it was highly enjoyable.  Unfortunately, Tim started to suffer from a case of travellers sickness, and we were in [[L2633]] two days longer than planned due to his inability to stray far from a bathroom.  A two day trip on a slow boat was started in caution.  Next stop [[L128]]......
Beer Lao Beer Lao Beer Lao                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [[L128]] is just spectacular....there is no other way to describe it. After much hassle with all the pleasures that come with travelling [[L215]], [[L128]] was simply heaven. Louang Phrabang is a beautiful old french colonial town, home to the most prized bhuddha in all of [[L128]] and some of the most nicest sales people you will ever come across in south east asia....no hassle when you walk into a shop and no bother walking down the night market. For once i actually felt very inclined to buy hilltribe handicrafts which are a complete tourist gimmick and I even wouldnt have minded a &quot;same same but different&quot; t-shirt!!!

we spent a good five days here taking in the sights, waterfalls and tigers...yes tigers and the river and trying to get to a museum that was closed on wednesdays, oh and how could i forget watching the world cup with a few Beer [[L128]] in hand....tim's hand that is!

We left the lovely town for Vang Vieng further south where the tourist trap is at the forefront....all you do in this tiny, and i mean tiny place is watch Friends 24/7 at one of the four friends bars and go 'tubing' a recreational sport lets say...where you are placed in a trucks inner tube and float downstream passing bars for beers, jumps and swings and whatever else takes your fancy! 

Even though Vang Vieng is a small place it is the most beautiful place to also just hang out and chill to your hearts content....the scenery next to our bangalow says it all!
{{1341|center}}

Moving on to Phonsavan....

We arrived to Phonsavan with one thing on our minds.....what on earth are the Plains of Jars???? Funnily enough when we got there, this is what we found!
{{1357|center}}

These jars are over 2000 years old, and have survived the test of time....including the two million plus bombs that were droppped in the area, of which 127 objects of unexploded ordanance had been removed and destroyed just so that we could see a little of area of the Jars.....Crazy!

No-one has a clear answer as to why the jars are there and what they were used for. Our guide did suggest that in a time of the Giants, these jars were their drinking pots... i think he thought we were foreigners that clearly had a mental age of 7 collectively! Just to give you a scale of these things.....
{{1353|center}}
and the most impressive thing about them is that they are solid stone, and carved out of boulders, making it seemingly impossible to transport from the quarry miles away from the site of the the plains! In all seriousness, the jars are thoug
New Look                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So, as you may or may not have noticed, we've got a new look for the site.  It's a bit more rounded and less cluttered, but still as cow-filled as ever.  Mostly, I've gotten rid of a bunch of things that are just taking up space, and moved them off to separate pages where they are still just as useful.  They're just not in your face all the time anymore.

{{1265|right}}This redesign has been a long time coming, as the old look was not pretty by any standard.  I actually paid real money to three separate designers to come up with logo ideas and concepts for a new site look-and-feel.  What I got back were a dozen flashy designs with lots of  blue chrome and pictures of happy couples walking on white sand beaches.  Had I been trying to sell electronics or package vacations in [[L22]], we'd be on to something here.  But for a site targeted at dirtbag backpackers writing reports from an internet cafe in [[L5023]], they didn't really fly.

In the end, my buddy Ben drew a rounded box on his Mac and put the word Blogabond above it.  Looks good enough to me.  Let's ship it!  Besides, the Web 2.0 crowd will love it.  Rounded corners, Tags, Clouds, even a Google Maps Mashup in there.  Top it off by putting the word &quot;beta&quot; in the logo, and next thing you know I'll be speaking at some conference about the future of the internet.

Anyway, [[L5247]] you like the new look!
Arriving into Vietnam                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Country No: 3 We arrived safely in Ha Noi, [[L240]], after a mamoth journey leaving from Phonsavan at 6am. We got on our bus to [[L2829]] and after picking up 15 people in phonsovan - all locals, we set off on our way. We got to the border at around 11.00am, and after a thorough bag inspection, and filling in our details we got into [[L240]] ok. The border crossing itself was easy enough: get off the bus; do the official business, and get back on about an hour later. We eventually arrived in [[L2829]] after many winding roads, and near-death experiences at around 8.30pm to be met by a guy called Hai, pronounced Hi, who informed us that we could get a minibus through to Ha Noi at a cost of $10, the 9.30pm minibus would arrive at around 3.00/3.30 in the morning. Yes, we decided to do this as we didnt want the hassle of finding a place to stay in [[L2829]] only to pack and leave early in the morning the next day. So we were picked up at Ha Noi bus station by a guy from the same tour /hotel company who showed us a guest house which was reasonably priced for a nice room. We crashed and burned big time.....never ever take sleep in a nice bed and a hot shower for granted!
Early doors at Hanoi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So [[L5133]] began as early start from our trip up across the border from [[L128]] and into [[L2829]], and it wasn't quite what we expected when we woke up in the morning. The noise of the traffic is immense and it never stops! Forget [[L5034]] or [[L1590]] or any other city in Europe, [[L5133]] is the king of motorcycle heaven. Every inch of the roads and even the pavements are covered with bikes! Hoever we managed to stay alive crossing the roads and explored the lake, the History Museum and the markets. After which we decided that a trip to Ha Long Bay was much needed. This is what this part of the world is famous for in terms of landscape.

{{1376|center}}

The hills and the limestone formations are something out of a fantasy; and the surealness of staying on the boat and watching the stars so clear above structures that seems to rise out of nowhere in the dark.

{{1386|center}}

Unfortunately you are quickly removed from the fantasy and brought back to the crass reality of Cat Ba Island. Imagine a Vietnamese [[L2737]] (No images neccesary!). Need I say more? And so back to [[L5133]] it was. 
The city of Hue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We booked our open bus tickets to travel through [[L240]] on the East coast and stopped next at [[L5337]]. Getting hold of a Belgian beer. Mission impossible in [[L240]]? Not really! We quickly located the Belgian Bar, the B4 Bar and enjoyed a couple of cheeky G&amp;T's with the lovely barman and was given good advice to eat at the [[L3097]] restaurant which served up a fantastic banana-flower salad and great BBQ skewers. 

The old citadel of [[L5337]] gives a glimpse of the country's reagl history and is a beatiful ruined moat city. 

{{DSCF0352.jpg|center}}

We reached the citadel after crossing the river to the other half of [[L5337]], and it is was well worth the walk to find the gate through the walled city which we actually walked past the first time round! Whoops!

Next was the DMZ tour where north meets south [[L240]]. We spent the day on the motorbikes of our tourguides who were from our guesthouse. This really was a great way to see this part of [[L240]]. We saw the effecs and the damage that still remains from the [[L240]]ese war. 

{{DSCF0381.jpg|center}}

The images are only a small insight, but nonetheless stil provides a huge understanding of somethig you only normally read about in books or watch in movies. 
Clothes....Lots of Clothes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Hoi An , the fisherman village, is our next destination. There is one word for this place: CLOTHES. There are over 500 tailors in this tiny village so imagine the competition faced for a tailor to get the business of every foreigner in town! We took a walk to a [[L3097]] restaurant and on the way past 50 of the 500 tailors, every colour and type of material and every design and cut of different clothes were bombarded on us. I thought it was great! Even Tim managed to get involved and had a few threads tailored for himself!
Back to the Beach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Next stop [[L5212]], another seaside resort town but with a very lively nightlife and wonderful beach chillout retreats!

From [[L5212]] our first mission was to do the Island tour around the coast which in the end entailed of more snorkelling, swimming and drinking than it did of island sightseeing. Still we jad a lot of fun and stopped off at the aquarium too to see the sharks and the coral centrepiece. 

{{DSCF0401.jpg|center}}

[[L5212]] also saw the last nights spent with our wonderful fellow travelling friends: Stace from [[L172]]; Kirsten from S.Africa and Trish from [[L38]]. So we couldn't leave them without having a big night out... Brit style! Even Tim managed to dance the night away until we all needed to be tucked up in bed! Of course the whole of the next day was spent recovering. Especially for Stace who put his health at risk to come out for a few drinks even though he was ill!

So now we were on our own again to make a quick journey through the rest of [[L240]] and across to [[L39]], then down to [[L156]] and Singapore to get our flights for the UK to return for a wedding in [[L79]]. Sounds simple doesn't it!
So Long Vietnam, last stop Saigon (AKA Ho Chi Minh City)                                                                                                                                                                                                        Upon arrival in Saigon we had some difficulty in finding a place, this was due to the fact that most guesthouses are not open at 6.00am-weird that.  A nice (but strange) lady helped us find a room above a bar, no guesthouse for us, but a spare room over a pub.  We were guaranteed that the noise would not be a problem, in fact we were told &quot;no sleep, you get money back&quot;, this relaxed us a lot.  So much so that we spent most of the rest of the day asleep.

Saigon was a nice place to end our stay in [[L240]], it was just as hectic as [[L5133]] but more relaxed at the same time.  We spent a good few hours in a lovely park where we reviewed our time in the country.  Overall, it was a good country to visit and we were both glad to have seen it, but I think some of the problems we experienced here soured the enjoyment a little.  On a more positive note, the bar we stayed over was definately one of the most entertaining places to stay in - EVER!  Next stop [[L39]]...
Phnom Penh, A Sobering City                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     {{1727|right}}

Another new country and another new attrocity to learn about.  [[L39]] was initially on our list of places to visit because of Angkor Watt.  During the course of our travels a lot of people had let us know that [[L5046]] contained some interesting but harrowing things to see.  After a day getting settled and arranging transport we decided that we should visit the Killing Fields and S21, a former primary school turned prison/interrogation camp.  Some of the things that we learned were horrific to say the least, and the images that we have cannot do justice to the scale of destruction that was inflicted upon the [[L39]]n people in the late 1970's.  

The photo to the right is of a shrine to commemorate some of those people slaughtered in and around [[L5046]].  Within this shrine there are a number of levels, each of which contains human remains dug up from the shallow graves discovered surrounding the area. As I said before, this place was harrowing...

{{1552|center}}
The Temples of Angkor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           {{1824|right}}

After spending a quick but very interesting few days in [[L5046]] we high-tailed it to Siem Reap to see what we hoped would be one of the highlights of our trip - Angkor Wat.  It is difficult to put into words exactly what to say about this place, so I will be brief.  WOW!  The whole place is an insight into the past that books, tv programs and even websites cannot dare to emulate.  We were both incredibly amazed from the minute we entered the area to the minute we left, I think this can be demonstrated by the number of photo's we took. Angor Wat is just one of the many temples within Angkor, it is the most easily recognisable. You have probably seen the following photo somewhere before. But obviously without Priya in it!

{{1818|center}}

Our favourite temple was Ta Phrom, this is because it is the only temple that has not been cleared properly since its discovery.  We managed to get lost in here for quite some time so we had plenty of opportunities to take photo's.  After much deliberation this is our favourite.

Country No 5 : Malaysia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [[L2267]] is truly a wonderful city and a far cry from what we had been used to in all the previous countries we had been to. The shopping malls are one of the first things that strike you as first enter KL and also the fantastic road conditions and public transport systems which are comparable to the UK in terms of standards. Combined with the low costs, reliability, cleanliness and ease of navigating, this really was a breath of fresh air! First stop in KL was to Chinatown where we got ourselves booked into a sweet hotel and lived it up for a night before getting down to business in a smaller Chinese establishment where we based ourselves for the next night. Chinatown is a bustling hub-bub of market stalls, restaurants and shops and has a great atmosphere except for the sometimes unbearable stench in the midday heat when every restaurant is brimming with customers and the smell of the kitchens become quite unbearable! Besides the chaos and fun in Chinatown, we headed towards the city centre and found ourselves (without a map) walking in the general direction of the Petronas Towers which can be virtually seen from any location within the city centre. Once we got there, our every expectation of the towers were fully satisfied. They really are as tall you can imagine, and with a shopping mall on the bottom floors full of every designer label store that you could care to think of, it was great fun spending a good few hours there! 

{{DSCF0563.jpg|center}}

Finally we spent our last night watching the fireworks display, which were coming from a promotion stand in a nearby plaza before hitting the Fun-theque! And no….it wasn’t really all that fun. It should have been called the Amusing-theque because it was certainly different let’s say! Curiosity always kills the cat!
Melaka                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We found ourselves a really nice hostel to stay in with really friendly staff here. [[L5303]] is a lovely little port town, and is definitely one of the highlights of [[L156]]. We kind of found ourselves reminiscing over Luang Phrabang here. It is similar in setup in that it has retained much of its colonial port history, and the town itself is very quiet with distinguished quarters and very friendly locals! We made a little tour of [[L5303]] by foot on the second day that we were there, and paid a visit to St. Paul’s church which is situated on the top of a hill. From here you get a wonderful view of the town, and the port by the sea which full size cargo ships anchored near the shore. It was also here that we met a nice artist who you felt you could have known for years! We had a good chat to him, and shared many giggles, and so we bought a painting from him. 

{{1862|left}}

[[L5303]] is nice quiet town, where you can rest and take your time looking around as we did, it is then that you can find yourselves little surprises like the cultural and handicrafts centre or the various restaurants and cafes with bags of character. I even managed to get Tim to race me to the top of a climbing frame and go on the see-saw. I wish I had a photo to show you all, but alas… definitely one of my favourite memories from here! Next stop, the final destination of our first leg of travelling, Singapore…..
Last Stop, Singapore....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Singapore is what everyone says it is....sanitised to the max and what some may view as ridiculous fines for things such as eating or drinking on the the underground, dropping litter or chewing-gum. However, the result is a clean city with a well mannered attitude towards others and property. In fact, we found Singapore to be even more multi-cultural than [[L156]] and rules strictly adhered to for your own safety and enjoyment of the city. So all in all, Singapore was a wonderful end to the first leg of our travels! Once we had checked in after a long day of travelling, I managed to persuade Tim (and myself!) to walk to the Little [[L106]] District. After what seemed like an age of a walk, we were rewarded with a fantastic meal at the Banana Leaf Restaurant! The curries there were beautiful and the smell of incense within the district was a pleasant alternative to the evening traffic pollution, even though a little overpowering. 

The next day we took a trip down the famous Orchard Road to see the shopping malls. Singapore is obscene in this sense. Wherever you turn there is plaza or mall that is essentially as big as Lakeside/Bluewater/etc... Imagine a street consisting of over 15 of these type of establishments and then add huge chain hotels, restaurants and bars, banks, offices and food courts; all on one road. It is simply a crazy place to be in! So as a retreat, we decided to go to the Botanical Gardens where the world renowned Orchid Gardens are situated. 

This place was beautiful and you find yourself instantly shut off from the hectic city life and the sounds of the traffic. The Orchid gardens themselves were stunning with almost every variety of orchid you can imagine! They even had one to comemorate Maggie Thatcher, and it was a very twisted looking plant that we thought was quite fitting really!

But the real highlights were lakes, the ginger garden and seeing the turtles that are resident to the lakes and wonderful tranquility of the whole area!

Next stop....home!
Happy to be Home....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            After a whirlwind few months we found ourselves back in the UK on the 28th of July.  To be honest it was great to see the family again, it felt like we'd only left them the week before even though we'd been away for three months.  After a few days Rest and Relaxation Priya and I were back travelling.  My brother was due to get married a week after we'd arrived back in the UK, which meant plenty of time to take it easy...not exactly.  The wedding was in Angles sur L'anglin which was a two and a half day drive to get to, at a very leisurely pace mind.  The wedding itself was absolutely wonderful.  Most of the extended families Brown and Bruce were there, with many other familes linked to those two, as well as numerous friends of the bride and groom.  It was a fantstic three day affair, with quality food, drink, music, socialising, beautiful scenery and near-perfect weather.  Overall, two thumbs definately up.

 With the wedding done and dusted we had a week left in [[L2776]].  This time was spent amongst family and friends, and getting pre-travel essentials like visa's, insurance, and kit sorted for part two.  On the Saturday night before our Departure Tim headed into London to meet up with some friends and have a few birthday drinks.  Thank you to anybody that was there, and many thanks for reminding me what it feels like to wake up a year older whilst feeling at least five years older at the same time.  The following day we had to bid farewell to families once more and embark upon part two of our journey.  Unfortunately due to the heightened security measures at [[L5391]] we had to arrive at the airport four hours before we were due to take off.  We managed this, and we managed to get through security with time to spare, just enough time for a few pints.  Nice!  We had a great time being back and it was arguably harder to leave this time than the first.  Anyhow, Back to Singapore... 
Malaysia Part II                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Singapore and [[L156]] were our rescheduled destinations for the next two weeks as we did not nearly enough cover all of what we wanted to see, let alone what the two nations have to offer! Our changes were made due to the unrest in central [[L104]] at the time of travelling, but we are still planning to travel through Bali and Lombok, circumstances permitting. 

So one night in Singapore knowing that we would soon be back meant that we were on our way up North, we had a stopover in [[L5303]], [[L156]]. Again it was a whirlwind stop here as we made our way to where we wanted to be, and that was to the wonderful Cameron Highands. It was a destination that came to be highly recommended by many people that we have met along the way of our travels, so we couldnt resist. And when we arrived we could see why they had recommended it so much. Unlike the choatic city of KL, or the quiet suburbs of [[L5303]]; [[L5385]], is high up, and you are in the middle of nowhere, and all that is around, are one many of the acres of tea tree plantations. 

{{2018|left}}{{2017|right}}

During our retreat in the hideaway town of [[L5360]], we went on a countryside tour, and saw the famous Boh Tea Plantations, we also visited a Rose Garden, Butterfly Farm, Insects Farm, Strawberry plantations and saw where the rich spent their time in the highlands. The best part of our stay however was the fact that we got to eat some of the best curries and indian breads in the world. The taste of the food from kumar's Restuarant will never leave my mouth!

Next stop Georgetown whilst we deliberate whether to visit the Perhentian Islands or Taman Negara, the worlds oldest rainforest......
Malaysia Part II continued...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   .....Taman Negara. Yes, we knew we would come here....its just not possible to do [[L156]] without a trip to the rainforest and do the famed canaopy walkway, and take in the breathtaking sights of the surrounding area and villages. So it was decided: we got oursleves back from the un-inspiring Georgetown and made our way down to KL; sorted out a next day departure to go to the rainforest, and sorted ourselves a place to stay in the forest village of [[L5503]] for two nights. We arrived to a beautiful and bright guesthouse, unpacked; had dinner on a floating restaurant; listened to our intro video of the forest (which was made in 1970's for sure!), and got oursleves in the back of a 4x4 to do the night safari! It was so much fun, and we did see some very interesting birdlife and insects. The leopard cat however stole the show, and we headed back to get a good nights rest before the canopy walk ahead of us.

{{2063|right}}
The walkway is something neither of us will ever forget, it was the most unusual way to explore the rainforest but possibly the most effective way to see it in a totally different way. From the canopy you didnt get a good idea of wildlife, but that was to be expected considering there are hundreds of visitors everyday climbing the walkway. However, you did get a good idea of the variety in foilage and how certain trees and plants fit into the whole ecosystem. As interesting as that all sounds I'm sure....the most important thing, was that we had a lot of fun that day, and shaking the bridge is not allowed as I was promptly informed!  

Back down the river the next day, and we headed back to [[L5303]] to get a couple nights rest and do laundry before getting to Singapore. Last stop, before we get to official country number 7!
Singapore Part II or is it Part III???                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Two last nights in Sigapore city, and oh how we will miss everything about it... except its costs! Well till next time that is, but with the way we've been travelling, that could be in a couple of weeks time! On our first night, we chilled out after travelling from [[L5303]], and headed to a nearby Chinese for some good food! We weren't that tired as it turned out, as we tuned in to watch the Emmy's!

On our second day, we got ourselves to Singapore Zoo. You can imagine how excited I was in particular, its been an age since either of us had been to the zoo, so we were both looking forward to it. And what a treat it was....definately one of our highlights of South East Asia. Now here was a zoo that had the right idea, no cages just moats and enclosures, variety, a real rainforest walk, the wildest of animals raoming freely (when you first see the orangutans hanging and playing in the trees above you, words cannot describe how you feel!) and most importantly real recognition for environment conservation.

We had a wonderful day looking at all the displays and watching the animals, from 12ft aligators to 12inch mousedeers, from the otters swiming lengths on its back in the pool, to giant polar bears tearing apart fish for lunch! 

{{2410|center}}

The highlights were definately the white tigers with their absolutely stunning coats and such regal postures, and the beastly looking wild dog which looked like it came straight out of the Val Helsing movie! Tim also managed to somehow inspire the sloth to move at lightning speed so that by the time Tim reached the platform where it had been lazily hanging about, it was now in the treetops of its enclosure a good 50-60 meters away from the platform!

We finished off in our favourite coffee house and lived up the Singaporean way of life, before we headed to the airport... Bali or Bust....
Country Number 7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Our first flight with Quantas: a proper wool blanket; nice food and drinks of choice and televisions as usual; and check us out with our electronic reclining seats with controls for the headrests, footrests and angles of the seat and back rest!!! OK so we weren't in economy, we had simply been allocated seats in Business/First class along with most people that were going to Bali and not [[L1031]]! But hey ho, we weren't complaining!

And to top it off, although we were arriving late in th evening to Bali, it was a beautiful sight from above when we were descending to the airport....a dark and vast sea with lights illuminating the boats offshore, and a tiny island awaiting us which looked just as dark except for the few beach resort areas, all lighted and sparkling away to us! We arrived to a small resort in Kuta and chcked into our luxury room overlooking the pool and garden which we had booked for a special price over the internet, (thank god for technology, and those every now and again guilty pleasures!)

{{DSCF0727.jpg|left}} So the next day we had a mooch around Kuta, and went to the beach. Nice but overcrowded and not looked after! And to be honest, people trying to sell you stuff and then being rude if you dont oblige is something we were growing tired of now. So dinner, and a few drinks is all good! The next day, we spent it shopping for a few goods we needed and just totally lazed our arses off at the pool! Can you blame us???


Loving Ubud!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    {{DSCF0743.jpg|right}}Headed up to [[L5538]], the central part of Bali and the hub-bub of all things cultural. We booked ourselves into a beautiful losmen where guesthouses are built around the family temple. The place was just serene and full of quiet animal life. We spent many hours just gazing into the bushes and trees, finding as many animals, birds and insects we could, as one of the family members would do their prayers in the morning. Next something a bit more active, we spent sometime looking around the town and passed through the markets. During our stay in [[L5538]], we rented a moped and ventured to a museum and surrounding villages; and visited a few cultural museums, one of which was dedicated to just female artists in Bali. It was well set out, and a lot information was available regarding particular pieces and all of the exhibited artists. Highlights however was finding the restaurant that served copius amounts of [[L1906]] everytime we visited, hence we visited a lot! And going to the Classical Dance perfomance set at [[L5538]] Palace, and how could I forget the hustle and bustle of the market (which Tim by the way, tried to avoid like the plague!) 

Following [[L5538]], we were craving a little of the beach life and decided to move on to the Gili Islands while we had the time to so, thus a quick stopover at [[L1725]] Bai which is a small fishing town and port to the Gili's and Lombok. Took the advice of Trish (from our travels before) and chilled out at the Ozone bar....the best food and the biggest mugs of tea ever (on bali anyway)!

Gili Trawangan....Paradise on Earth....Really!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                Absolute paradise on a 4 x 2km island off the west coast of [[L5539]]! Stunning beaches and coral, BBQ fish and salads every night, films and bars. We could've been back in [[L128]] in Vang Vieng! We had a bit of nightmare journey getting to the island, first off, we didnt get on the boat to the Gili's by stepping off a pier as usual, instead we had to take off our boots and socks, roll up our jeans, and carry our bags on to a small boat that we had to wade across the shore to get to, before we could get into the big boat to get to the island. It was the same deal getting off the boat to the shore of Gili Trawangan but this time in the pitch black with no lights! And did I mention, I got seasick!!!! Yuk! it was all worth it though!

{{DSCF0770.jpg|center}}

Anyway after the boat ride we had to find accomodation, easy one might think....but as every traveller in SEA will know, this isn't the case. We got led to a number of guesthouses by a random bloke, the first place we saw had cockroaches and massives spiders in the small room! If you know Tim, you'll know he doesnt like spiders bigger than the size of his fist, so you can imagine his face when I pointed out this tarantula sized beast on the bathroom wall! The second place was the same sort of story but a bigger room. We eventually pissed the man off enough with our fussiness so that he left us alone and we eventually found a nice hut close to beach and behind a small bar that shows movies every night. (Cockroach landed on me and went up my skirt when we were watching a movie there, come to think of the place now!)

We enjoyed a beautiful walk around the island, passed many secluded beaches and found many pieces of dried coral, some with their colour still and many urchin shells! Found a lovely cafe on the part of the island thats best to view the sunset from, and had the tastiest fresh coconut milkshakes we have had since arriving to this part of the world! The rest of our time was spent enjoying a movie at the beach, eating woodfire pizzas, walking on the beach and having a few G&Ts at the Irish bar. Now thats the beach life!
Bali Finale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Time is almost up in Bali, so we headed back from Gili Trawangan to our favourite spot in Ubud, and yes, we did go back to the arak serving resatuarant, this time we also got rice wine....nice with honey and lemon if youve never had it before! We spent a few days here getting ourselves sorted with clean laundry and another book for Tim - we didnt do anything crazy this time round in Ubud, we just wanted to make the most of those banana pancake breakfasts and the great Balinese food, and chill out at our losmen and enjoy its beauty. Bali has been a wonderful place to visit. We got back into the routine of having most people selling you stuff only to rip you off, still, sometimes you cant help yourself but get the pendant that is going for twice the price than in the shop, like I did! If it helps the economy, I dont mind. We eventually got our stuff packed and ready to go, left our favourite restaurant, and said goodbye to our losmen and the family who lived there, and Karma who looked after us, and became my little hero giving me a ride back to the guesthouse when my slippers broke in the streets! Thank you Tim, for putting up with my 'little' tantrum when that happened! Next stop, airport and a plane to [[L1031]] via Jarkarta!

Country Number 8!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               So we arrive at Denpasar Airport, Bali. We have our Air Asia flight booked to get us into Jakarta well in advance of our departure for Sydney. Sounds like this is going to be straightforward right?

So, we get to airport ready to check in and we are told that the flight will be delayed until around 6pm. This was a four hour delay, but we were assured that we would have plenty of time to get our connecting flight and that getting from arrivals to international departures would be easy. Ok we say, as long as there are no more delays. We didnt really have any other choice but to stay and wait because our only alternative was to get a refund and buy a ticket on the spot from another carrier....like that was going to happen for the price we originally paid, not that they had tickets going anyway. There were so many delays and cancelattions from and to Jakarta that every carrier was operating a waiting list. Anyway, we eventually got our flight after a third delay and finally took off after 7pm. The flight was fine, and we got off fine with our luggage, however this was after waiting half an hour for the luggage that we were originally told would be prioritised to leave the plane first; so by this point we had less than 15mins to get to departures and check in and clear customs and get stamped out of the country before the flight leaves, thats right, not gates closing but plane leaving tarmac!!!

Get this, we had to get a taxi....first the fares were starting at 200,000 rupiah, then a guy came from nowhere and could see we were upset, and took us for 20,000 which is about the right amount to pay for the distance covered. (PS 17,000 rupiah = 1 GBP.) With me almost in tears at the way we had been treated let alone the fact that our flight had been delayed, the taxi man put his foot on it, and got us to departures after a few near misses! Not that I condone reckless driving, I am just thankful he got us there!

This is the best bit though; we explained at the CLOSED check in desk that we were late because of the delayed flight from Bali, and they told us to get in the 'exit country and get your stamp' queue quickly, get stamped out of the country and run with our backpacks to the plane, leave the bags with the security at the plane door and get into our seats. OH MY GOD. I have never been so stressed in all my life and suddenly my backpack got 20 kilios heavier. Tim and I somehow managed to get to the plane and through security even though technically our luggage was now hand luggage! We slumped into our seats and got

Tom...on tour !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 THURSDAY

...Epic 10 hour flight..... 

At first I thought "Hey loads of leg room...this is great" 

7 hours later im in agony as there is no comfortable position to get into especailly as the massive fat guy sat in front seemed to be pressing his chair as far back as possible into me !! 

<B>FRIDAY</B>

Anyway I get to [[L98]] relatively ok, 
as soon as I get off the airport bus I get lost on this massive Road (Nathan Road) and cant find my hotel, according to the guide it was next to the bus stop but it turned out to be a 15 min walk away, a nightmare when the place is crawling with a million Chinese people all running around at full speed.

{{3808|left}}{{3801|left}}<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

I eventually get to the hotel absolutely knackered as its now 4am UK time... 
thankfully they let me check in early even though im 3 hours before normal check in time. 
anyway I have a sleep for a few hours then im out on the town checking it out, 
I get measured up for some clothes..for the wedding, Im off to pick them up later today, about 50 quid for custom made trousers and shirt, think ive been ripped now as ive seen them for half the price off a bit but bit late for that.
 

Anyway then I find a cheeky little Chinese place with some cute chicks serving up noodles so I decide to eat there, and am sat next these 3 western guys, virtually the first western people I've seen, so I start chatting to them they turn out to be from [[L166]] and [[L12]]... 

I hang around with them for the rest of the evening, we got some beers from a corner store and sat out on the bay watching the sights and having a good laugh, and even start chatting with some Chinese guys who were all sat around drinking 
near by


SATURDAY 

Next day meet up with the Norwegian and [[L12]]n guys again, and went over to the other island where the Peak tram is, which takes you to the highest point in [[L98]] with brilliant views of the place ! got some great pics. 
<br>
{{3803|left}}{{3802|left}}
<br>
<br>
Then just hung around in the Japanese quarter for a while, had some Japanese food and stuff, 
then we got the star ferry back over to Kowloon where we were all staying..was on the ferry at 8pm when the laser light show starts on both sides of the water so that was awesome ! 
finally ended the evening having some Korean foods in a funky place where they bring you raw food and you have a little BBQ in the middle of your table...and you get to sizzle the whole thing up your self, which was cool! 


SUNDAY 
Visiting Jules & Pascal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <B>Monday</B>

So I arrive in [[L1028]] after flying over from [[L98]] on the Sunday night, a 8 hour flight this time, and I got some extra leg room as I was sat in the emergancy exit area so that was pretty cool, the girl at the desk said I could sit there if I helped out in an emergancy, I thought I’ll probably be asleep the whole way so who cares!

The only problem was it was an old plane so no interatve movie choice this time!

Anyway I get to [[L1028]], and Julie comes to pick me up at the airport and head back to their place, I didn’t sleep much on the plane nor on my last night in HK so Im very tired, but [[L5471]] through the day to go to bed at a normal time…

That first day is spent with a whirl wind tour of [[L1028]], which is a really nice city, really clean and looks great!

Then I attend the wedding rehersal with them out in Swan Vally where they are getting married, Its so hot and im so tired, Im beginging to think Its all gone a bit pear shaped,

But in no time we are in a brewery called Mash which is great beer brewed on site which is fantastic, and some great food…Im realy falling asleep now though.

That night I sleep for 13 hours…about time too !

<B>Tuesday</B>

Today we shoot off to one of their local beaches they seem to live between [[L1028]] centre {{3887|right}}and Freemantle or Freo as they call it.
{{3888|left}}
This is a really chilled out bohemian quarter…. imagine Princess Ave with all the new bars but scrap the other side of the road and stick an amazing beach there instead…ideal !

So first swim in the sea, at Cottosloe beach really warm with fine golden sand, and clear warm water, Great!

We finish the day with a traditional Aussie Barbie…but not a shirp in sight, just steak & beer…by this time im beginging to think their beers kick ours into touch!

<B>Wednesday</B>

Do nothing as I feel like crap, didn’t sleep to well the night before, and did a work out leaving me feeling awful all day, so im in the lounge with the air con, and a few dvd’s ?

<B>Thursday</B>

The others arrive from England mainly from Hull…so spend the day chatting to them and having a few drinks.
The wedding pace is picking up so its fever pitch with Best men and Bridesmaides flying about the place!

The bride to be and all her entourage disapeer leaving the boys to have a mini bucks night with menay beers and another Barbie.

<B>Friday</B>

The Wedding….all get up about mid day and get ready…


It all kicks off at about 4, so it’s started to cool off a touch; the weddi
Up the west Coast !!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As we head up the coast towards [[L5601]], looking at it on the map..looks like you'd be there in a couple of hours but its over 6 hours later that the convoy rolls into town after one burst tyre and several service stations later !

We set up camp at a beach front campsite, really nice place, in this sleepy beach front town on the edge of the outback, 
<br>
{{3938|left}}
<br>
Its very green for such a dry place, really nice and warm too ! approx 28C

That evening is spent with a few beers round the camp with fish and chips, 
the next day we shoot off in the cars down a 30 km dirt track to the gorges,
<br>
{{3948|left}}{{3940|right}}
<br>
This however is hot ! I reckon its 40 over in the gorge, away from the coast...Im almost passing out !
<br>
{{3950|left}} {{3951|right}}
<br>

<P>
After an hour of checking this place out we drive back up to the coast to find a great beach where we play beach football and go for a swim...nice to think I'm doing this while your all shuffling about in the rain !

That evening we all go out for a spot on meal, and have all sorts...crock....kangaroo etc !! {{3959|left}}

First thing in the morning, we pack up our campsite, and they all get ready to head back to [[L1028]], they drop me off at the sea front, and as they drive off leaving me looking out over the sea, for a moment I just stood there thinking..sh1t I'm completely on my own in the middle of nowhere !

But I find the hostel in no time, and waste no time checking in, and getting my bunk sorted.

Within an hour I was chatting to some guys in my dorm, a couple of Sweedish guys and a German, after chatting for a while discovered we were all making a similar journey up the west coast, they told me they were going snorkeling, so I tagged along..bought a snorkel along the way and headed out to the Blue Pools, some large rock pools just a short walk down the coast, an amazing deserted beach where we dived into the pools and started checking out the marine life trapped in these large rock pools.
<br>
{{3962|left}}{{3961|right}}
<br>
...anyway so after a bit of that, we walked back down the beach back to the hostel.
where I chilled out most of the afternoon chatting some other travelers...Julia a [[L2738]] Fan informed me [[L2738]] won and Chelsea lost so that put a smile on my face...<b>shame I wasn't in the office to rub Kev's nose in that one</b> !! 
{{3961|left}}{{3960|right}}

That eveing I had a couple of beers with Torston the German guy on the beach... really feel like im traveling now,

Th
Dolphin-tastic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  So I arrive in [[L5602]] quite late on Wednesday night, So I hit the sack as its an early start to [[L5603]] in the morning !

7.45 the next moring we are on the local bus with the Sweedish guys to the place known as [[L5603]], where they feed and research the Dolphin from this beach front national park,

I got the chance to take a fish out into the bay and feed one of the dolphins, this was really amazing !!
{{3964|left}}{{3965|right}}

There is sorts of wildlife in this place I saw Pelicans on the beach and saw a stingray in the sea while I was snorkaling...
{{3966|left}}{{3967|right}}

<br>
...Anyway seems like a long day as you have to wait unitl 4pm for the return bus, but get back to the hostel, and meet up with a bunch of people from another coach tour that I met the previous night in [[L5601]], Its about this time, I notice the Sweedish guys have no sense of humor so I kind of give them the slip and have a few games of pool and a few beers with a few guys and girls staying in the hostel!

they show a film each evening in this open air cinema, at the hostel, everyone was pretty shocked to see them put on Wolf Creek, a pretty gory horror film about backpackers..not the best chioce !

the next day I do some serious chilling out ! just lounging around watching England getting a schooling in the Ashes, and go for a quick snorkel, before the bus comes to take me up to [[L5654]] at sunset!

Week 1 of Australia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             {{2456|left}}So we have arrived and are enjoying the comfort of newly aquired apartment. We are looking to stay and work here in [[L12]] for a while but before we anything as serious sounding as that we were going to do a bit of sightseeing and what is going to [[L1031]] without taking your first walk to the city and the harbour. First off, it was so nice to e back in a Western Environment except for the food part - our jellie bellies weren't so nice now that we are back to processed and junk foods galore. It is amazing how bad we can eat. But anyway enough of that, as Tim and I wander through the city with help of our trusted [[L1031]] Guide picked up from the airport and Tim's handy little AA guide courtesy of [[L2776]] collegues we headed in the vague direction of Circular Quay - where we are told is the central hub of transport to [[L1031]] Harbour and all of its delights. Before we knew it, we could see a glimpse of what lay ahead and as you can imagine I was getting very excited!

{{2457|right}}Next thing we know, we can see the harbour and with the bridge in full view and the opera house; it really is all that but it looked so much smaller than I imagined it to be! The illusion of TV and Posters eh! Nonetheless, here we both were, literally half way around  the world and on the start of our long stay in OZ. The whole panoramic view of the harbour is beautiful but we knew we were no longer in Asia because all of a sudden, the price of food, drinks and convenience goods just got a lot higher and the atmosphere is totally different. It was actually quite striking how different the Aussies look compared to Europe, both phyiscally and in aesthetically. Glamour is not quite the word I am looking for, but there is a clear effort towards it. 

We took a little walk around the harbour, and took in the views of the opera house and headed back to the city to grab som food and a long awaited Guiness. We also enjoyed the pleasure of going to the supermarket so that we could make full use of our apartment. To be honest we are just glad we can relax and feel so comfortable while we shake off the jetlag and our dodgy stomachs!

PS Mum, Neighbours looks like its starting to get good!
Sun, Sand and Surf!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             {{2477|left}}The next day, we went back to the harbour, again with our trusted guides and a bagful of tourist information leaflets and guides etc.... (No anoraks dont worry guys!) This time we headed towards the botanical gardens; here you walk along the harbour front and  get a fantastic view of the opera house in front of the harbour bridge; or you can just go for a walk around the gardens and see all kinds of beautiful flora and fauna. And loads and loads of fig trees.  

{{2478|right}}The place is just crammed with so many species of animals and birds, for the first time on our travels we saw so many macaws and parakeets. Again many of the same kinds of trees as in South East Aisa; but a totally different variety of shrubs and bushes. You noticed things like no or few Ginger plants, at least not the way they are in SEA with their bright and big flowers, and no lillies. And just like Singapore, plenty of orchids to set my hayfever off to Tims great delight! Unforntunately we spet too much time looking at the ridiculous amount of fruit bats in the palm trees that we were unable to take a peek at the carnivorous plants exhibition - another day maybe -  but we did get to see lizards, more bats and parots, strange looking black and white birds that make a hellava racket and loads of kookaburras. I was all good though, being a fan of Dot and the Kangaroo when I was a little girl, made me quite a happy bunny to see them!

We took a walk back through the city and saw the landing point of the Pomms from back in the day. Saw a beautiful cathedral, walked past the Olympic Training Simming Pools, saw a few statues, and monuments and took a walk through 'The Rocks' - an older part of town, etc, etc....

To start wrapping the end of our tourist stay in [[L1031]], we also took a trip to [[L5645]], which is on the other side of the habour  and [[L1031]] City, to get there we took a ferry from the harbour. It is basically the [[L2798]] of [[L1031]], where everyone goes to get out of the city and enjoy some quiet beaches and take a promenade walk. But the good thing is, that it isnt full of retired people, and the beach really is lovely. We took a walk along the beach and chilled out there for the most part of the day. I'd never seen people surf before, its kind of weird watching them do their thing, you look at them, and you would  think its almost impossible to stay on top of the waves like that, but they do and it looks great! I envy their sense of balance so much! 

After some sand, and surf we decided to get more su
Week 2 - Melbourne                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              {{4096|left}}Next up - Melbourne and with a little help from some friends we had a place to stay to base ourselves from - to which we are very grateful for, given the price of getting around and acomodation and all the stuff in between. Tim and I were staying next to the beach but at this end of Australia there isnt a lot between you and the Antarctica - you can imagine we werent too impressed with how cold it was!!! Especially in the night/evening when the temperatures just plummets! I invested in a scarf which was just biggest joke ever, given that we have just been in 30+ degree climates and it is appraoching summer here in Australia where temperature are same if not in some cases worse!!! In any case, I was so grateful for my scarf, hoodie, jumper and jeans! The beach itself in Melbourne is pretty small but the sea front walk stretches all the way down the coast beyond St Kilda's and beyond the city in the other direction. 

We spent some time in Melbourne exploring the city and loving its more European feel, particularly with the huge cafe culture here. We also took advantage of the dining out experience and the huge range of Australian Wines, they're not half bad! We ate a lovely Italian Restaurant that did wonderful pizzas - filing too and the tastiest we had since arriving into Australia. We also did a stop at the Melbourne Museum and got our first insight into the varied landscapes of Australia and even did ourselves a Rainforest Walk. We also got our first insight into the Aboriginal ways of life and their history in Australia before and after the Europeans arrived. The whole experience was interesting since we hadnt done a museum in a little while now, however, we found it to be quite disorganised and that did make it all a bit frustrating because it was a shame finding out that there were more parts to the museum that we just did not have the time to appreciate. In a nutshell, the museum was more of an exhibiton for a bit of science, natural history, environmental issues, human evolvement, biology, zoo-ology, australian history, politics, art.....you get the idea; all a bit disjointed and a serious lack of focus.  

We did some more sightseeing of the city including a surprise viewing of the AFL team as they were due to be playing the Finals at the weekend. Screaming girls and one of the players named 'Ricky' wasnt cool, so we got out of the mayhem and saw an open air exhibition of photos from the sky around the world. The exhibition is called 'Earth From Above and sound familiar to some. It takes a
Coral Bay !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     About high time I updated you on [[L5654]]…pretty much the last leg on this trip and the furthest point north I will travel for quite a while

Leaving [[L5602]] to come to [[L5654]] was ment to take about 7 hours, however due to Greyhound buses being driven by complete monkeys, we arrive 11.5 hours later…(that’s longer than Manchester to [[L98]])

This includes a stop at a Road House (service station) for over 2.5 hours at 2am…& as this place is away from the Coast…its damn hot, even at 2am its almost 30C

Anyway finally get moving, and arrive in [[L5654]] at 5.30 am…
At this point I just need to sleep, so I find my room…a 4 bed dorm with 3 girls in it asleep….I have to make the top bunk while a girl is asleep below…I’m thinking 

“if she wakes up and I’m stood at the foot of her bed this is really gonna freak her out” 

So I basically don’t make the bed very well, and clamber all over her as there is no ladder…clearly waking them all up in the process…but who cares…I’m finally in bed

So Next day up about 11, go for a little explore, check out the beach, the pub, etc, all looks nice, Beach looks like the best so far…

Spend most of the day just reading and chilling out, and rustle up a spag bol.

Later on the People I met in the previous Hostel arrive on their bus, so we have a few beers in the evening, and then later head on down to the beach about 11pm armed with a box of beer and spend the next couple of hours sat by the waters edge drinking many beers and having a good laugh! {{4077|right}}

The next day I’m pretty hung over so miss the morning at the beach with the rest of the gang, I prefer to stick on the air con, draw the curtain and roll over!

I finally get my self up and about in the afternoon, Meet up with them down on the beach, we walk down the coast to a shark nursery where the young sharks seem to “hang out” there’s probably about 50 of them in a small concentrated bay, as they are all reef sharks and fairly harmless we wade into the water scaring most of them away, but as we stand still, in time they swim back around us…being surrounded by sharks is pretty freaky even if they are reef sharks…. later we find out threes the occasional Tiger shark in there with them…Doh!!
<br>
That evening we head back down to the beach at sunset to check that out before we walk back to the Hostel and prepare out massive BBQ…

Kings Cross but not as you and I know it!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So Back in [[L1031]] but still no sightings of any kangaroos or bushfires even though we were apparantly driving past them on the route we had taken to get back. You could smell the burnt wood however, and the most disturbing thing was seeing the lack of water anywhere. We knew that [[L12]] is and has been having a lot of water problems and in many places there has been a drought for over 6 years. But the extent of this problem was certainly more apparent as we were driving through some of the arid parts of New South Wales and near the Victoria Borders. Wells are totally dried up and water troughs are just overgrown with weeds. The land is incredibly dry and there is very little green for cattle to graze upon. 

So we returned to [[L1031]] with the aim of finding ourselves a place to stay for the next few months and a job to cover our costs and save a little for the rest of travels. We booked ourselves into a hostel on Kings Cross - it being a center for backpackers and a hub for the nightlife of [[L1031]]. We had been warned and to be honest we were curious and it would be a place of interest or rather an interesting place ticked on the list. The latter was an understatement!!!! ;o) 

We found ourselves in a dingy place and argued a dorm of our own because we were initially placed in a dorm with four other guys who had clearly been on a boozy one the night before - at the 7am the room did not smell pleasant!!! The room we were put in, was actually quite nice and we were happy with it - besides it was only going to be for a few days. We got straight on the internet and sorted ourselves some viewings on an ongoing basis as with the applications to various agencies etc. 

Kings Cross is quite a pleasant place with shops and cafes and the usual city bustle, until about 4/5pm. In true Richard Attenborough style - "this appeared to be the time when the more unusual of the human species started to come out to play." Streets would be littered with drunks, and hobo's and at the risk of being really racist - abo's everywhere drunk and out of their mind, along with the druggies and the pimps and ho's. Thats right....Kings Cross is the Red Light District and it was a great place to have a bit of fun and see a totally different side to [[L1031]]! Even the tourist buses come through for a cheeky peek! As for Tim and I, we enjoyed just watching the weird and wonderful world below us from the comfort of our room, where we had a balcony (being on the third floor) allowing us to have front seats of the pimps, pushers, prostit
4mm allen wrench                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                First, I'l admit to a certain level of anxiety as I finally set off on my bike: what am I going to find, and worse, what will I accidently leave behind?  The answer to the second is easy: something crucial.

I left [[L5670]] at 2 pm, after dealing with the certainty that my maps were inadequate.  Actually, I didn't deal with it: I convinced myself I was OK with what I had. I put my feet to the pedals for a stylish takeoff (hotel staff and tourists were watching), and promptly discovered that both trailer tires were flat.  No holes, just flat.  Filled those up, put my feet to the pedals for that stylish takeoff, got around the corner, and discovered I'd forgotten my helmet (yes, Polly, I'm wearing my helmet).  Back to ask the hotel staff what they did with my helmet...and finally back to those feet on the pedals.

The plan for this trip was wind at my back (the Harmattan blows south in these parts).  The first 20km was wind in my face across a long causeway to [[L2642]], which I hit at around rush hour.  The beauty of that was I inhaled enough particulates to call it dinner.  By nightfall I had barely exited urbanity, and found a campsite next to a highway.

Never camp next to a highway.  After snuggling in and then wrestling with the idea of digging into my bags for more clothes and some ear plugs for about two tiresome hours, I finally got up the energy to do it.  It didn't work.  I didn't sleep.  Great start.

{{4738|center}}
JVC plant to the left, shipping container yard, tent and bike and trailer, water retention basin, highway.  Big, loud, noisy all night highway.

Toothpicks, by the way: the only alternative to floss that I could find.  More than you wanted to know.
Rain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            About that 4mm allen wrench: its crucial, and I left it in Sidi Bou Said.  It is sitting on a low wall on the terrace of the hotel where I locked my bike and where noone will see it for the next 2 years.  Next time you need one, you know where to look.

John and Larry at Pedal Power: the first time my bike fell, the weight of it caused one of the Profile bottle cages (selected for its flexibility to hold wide Nalgene bottles) to shear right off.  The bike world needs a metal version of that design.  Of course, to get rid of the shorn remains, I needed a 4mm allen wrench.

I stopped at a motorcycle repair shop in Mornag to ask about a 4mm allen wrench, but could only get the guy to unscrew the broken bottle cage with his wrench.  Charge: 50 cents.  At the next shop I could get the guy to understand I wanted the wrench and not the screwing, and he handed me his to keep.  Charge: Free.

Back to those possibly inadequate maps.  I'm relying on Michelin maps at 1:1000000 and printouts from Google Earth with placenames for my route only imported.  Unfortunately, the roadsigns and the placenames don't match.  I admit to the following idiocy, and don't tell anyone:

Michelin says take a right in the middle of Mornag.  I saw the turn and decided it wouldn't get me where I wanted to go.  I went straight, saw a left to get to the freeway, and thought that going straight might be what Michelin meant by taking a right.  (OK, this explanation gets no easier from here: skip ahead with the knowledge that I'm an idiot if I've lost you already).  I kept going straight, saw no recognizable placenames, and decided finally that I was on a different road that was less scenic but would also get me where I wanted to go.   Rain began to fall.  I thought that the road was awfully narrow to be the road I now thought I was on, but kept going anyway.  All day.  Buckets of rain.  I decided what I really needed was one of those tourist hotels in Hammamet, on the coast.  If I was on the road I thought I was on, then I had only 10 km to go.  Night fell: I was so completely miserable that those hotels were now irresistable (ever try to set up a tent in the dark in the rain?) and I kept going by sense of smell and weak headlights.  I met some police and asked them if the next left would get me to Hammamet.  Oui.  How far? 30 km.  I thought: "They don't know what they're talking about".  Off I went in the dark.  10 km.  Mountains ahead.  Something was wrong.  I found a lonely cafe, walked in to see George Clooney selling Nespresso on French TV

No snooze button.

It's raining.  Hard.  The road's out up ahead, until around noon 2 cop cars zoom by on the trail of 10 men who robbed a bank in Hammamet, to indicate that the flooding has subsided.  I decide to find one of those hotels in Hammamet, get all my wet clothes back on (its worse than it sounds, but fine once you're out in the rain), and head out.

Eat with me!  You won't eat with me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            {{4800|center}}
This is Mohamed el Amied Ben Hedili Ben Mohamed Ben Romd’hane, storekeeper, father of 2 children (ages 2 and 3), devout Muslim, and gentleman of real character.  I approached him simply to buy a spoon.  

"Une cuiller seulement"?  
"Oui, une".  

He quickly had one of the 2 guys working for him find an old spoon.  While they were cleaning it and I was wondering what an old spoon would cost me, he invited me to eat with him.  Though I told him I must go, he quickly set up two packing crates inside his store, brought out dates, olives, olive oil, chili paste, milk and water, and told me to have a seat.  I did as I was told.

About the milk: apparently fresh from the cow.  I admit to some reticence.  Lots of solid material that tasted kind of cheesy, with a slightly sour tinge and just a hint of the flavor you expect from the pasteurized, homogenized stuff.  I was assured it was vital to keep me strong on my trip, and finally dug in for a couple of cups full.

Center for Disease Control advisory on traveller's health: "Avoid dairy products, unless you know they have been pasteurized".

Mohamed proved to be open-minded, but suggesting strongly that I read the Quran so that I might afterwards allow myself a choice.  It definitely made me regret not bringing an English version along on this trip, if only to set the context.  As far as Mohamed is concerned, there is no book with as many good answers to life’s important questions.  I thought: why not?

Western culture fears Moslem culture, let’s face it.  Facing the strange, the unknown, the “Other” requires a certain sense of security and trust, which seems to be diminishing despite everyone’s best efforts.  The [[L164]] just banned the burkha, for example, a move that frankly reminded me of the old dress code we had in Junior High. No jeans children!!  

It wasn’t the jeans but what they represented, and so it is with the burkha.  Holland is impoverishing its own culture, and nullifying one of it’s most generous and well-known tenants: tolerance.

Back to Mohamed: we ate and chatted as he and his employees dealt with a jostle of customers, and when it was time for me to go, he handed me 2 plastic bags filled with groceries and took not a single Dinar.  I said “Mohamed, il y a une difference entre l'amitie et l’argent.  Laisse-moi payer pour ces choses”.  He told me “Une autre temps, peut-etre”.  I bicycled away and found a scooter at my elbow not 3 kilometers later: it was Mohamed with that spoon I had originally approac

Stay!

25 Dinar buys a room without heat in a hotel under renovation, but hot water runs from 8pm to midnight.  It's enough, and a hot bath and dinner downstairs of couscous and chicken and bread (baskets of bread!) and pastry and cafe au lait make it perfect.

Here's the view out of my window in the morning.  Unheated room = lot's of condensation.

{{4837|center}}
I pulled in at 6pm, just after dark, my first 100km day.  I'm here for 2 nights to give myself time to buy some crucial stuff:
1. a new knife (this trip keeps eating utensils, have you noticed?)
2. some warmer sleeping gear (seduced by the weight of the lightest Marmot sleeping bag-rated to 30F and weighing only 1lb-I supplemented with a Dupont liner-rated an additional 15F-and thought I had the problem elegantly licked.  In fact, I didn't factor in just how little heat I'm generating at the end of a long day on the bike: I am FREEZING and have a new appreciation for hypothermia.
3. warm socks

By the way, that spoon I lost...it came back.  Now I have two.  It was hiding under the fold of one of my outer pockets, and it wasn't until I unpacked absolutely everything last night in trying to find my knife, that I found the spoon.  The knife (with attached bike lock key and handy LED light) is definitely history.  Two theories: this guy I met two nights ago stole it, or I accidently threw it away with a bag of [[L3083]] peels and empty yoghurt containers.  Full story:

After leaving [[L5687]] (and NOT staying in the 5 star hotel that beckoned so...so...seductively), I bicycled another 25km into the middle of farm country.  Mud absolutely everywhere.  I was about to plant my tent on a concrete cistern to get out of the mud when a 15 year old kid bicycles by and suggests I follow him.  I do.  For half an hour.  It gets dark.  Suddenly he says goodbye, and leaves me standing there wondering what that was all about.  20 minutes later I find a house that looks like its under construction, and plant the tent on a concrete pad.  Dogs begin to howl, and they don't stop for an hour.  Ensconced in the tent, I implant some earplugs and hope for the best.  Half hour later, flashlights and muttering outside the tent.  I ignore it and they go away.  15 minutes after that, more flashlights and muttering, and this time I'm rousted by the owner of the house and his ne'er-do-well brother.  They suggest I make myself at home inside the house where it will be warmer.  Up comes the tent and everything in it, to be placed in the house.  

I'm left there with the brother: he can't stay in [[L222]], he wants to travel and work abroad but can't get a visa, and can I help him find work in the [[L233]] or Europe?  He hasn't been to school, he drives a truck occasionally but doesn't have a job, h
Lunch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           [[L113]] rings out the old year with a hanging, the Krabbendams are making deep fried Dutch treats, and I’m watching Al Jazeera from a hotel room on the main square of [[L5695]], [[L222]].

I spent the morning with Google Earth, addressing my concerns about navigating the desert just south of here, and then took off for the 75 kilometer run down to [[L5695]].  [[L5691]] was a ghost town: everything closed down for Eid.  I bought a baguette and a big bottle of water from the Oasis hotel before I left (pink bathrooms notwithstanding, a great little hotel: very nice people, heat and hot water on demand, deep bathtubs, pretty good buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner, wi-fi in the reception area, and they even gave me the 10% very-tired-Dutch-biker-stumbling-in-after-dark discount).

The roads were empty.  No trucks, infrequent cars, and a sunny, clear day as well.  Nonetheless, with only 6 hours of daylight left to cover 75 kilometers over hilly terrain, I was moderately concerned about arriving before dark.  In Arram, 35 kilometers from [[L5695]] and just beyond a town named Mareth, as I stopped for a drink of water, a man accosted me and would not let me go on.  I tried reasoning with him, to no avail.  It was have a meal with his family or else! (I know that was cheap, preying on all your fears).

I put away my little plan to get to [[L5695]] (heat, hot water, security…), eased my mind into accepting a night out in the tent, and accepted the invitation.  The whole clan was gathered at the ancestral home: the son from up north, the cousin from [[L1590]]…all hanging out on mattresses in the shadow of the house in the yard.

Lunch was eaten on the mattresses: grilled mutton, couscous, some kind of mildly spicy red sauce, tea, more tea…the father of the clan had some kind of technical job, the guy that pulled me off the road, Karboub Mohamed, works for the water utility SONEMED in Sfax, and the brother, Karboub Belgacem (always the brother!) had studied at the university, spoke some English, and couldn’t find a job.
{{4918|center}}
The Karboub Clan of Arram, [[L222]]

I took pictures of all the men, who were hanging out separately, and when mom demanded to know why I didn’t take a picture of the women, I took pictures of the women.  One young girl appeared seriously disturbed, and I was somehow heartened to see her ensconced, protected, embraced in the middle of the female clan.

As I left I got the pitch to find some work abroad for Belgacem.  With the sun already setting, I made a try for [[L5695]] a
New Years Eve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Left waiting in [[L5696]] for 2 days until government offices reopen to get a special permit to cross a restricted zone to the Algerian border, I heard of a New Year’s celebration up in the hills and caught a ride from the hotel.

It was in a granary (or "Ksar" or "Qasr") built like a fort, all stone and arched openings, a single entry portal, and command of the surrounding countryside.  Inside, open fires provided smoke and warmth and light, and we sat under draped tents of wool cloth as food was served in 8 courses and a band played to a crescendo at midnight.  Italians, Dutch, Canadian, Tunisian, Portuguese…managing in any number of languages to share this cloudy night.

When we finally stepped outside the sky had cleared and a radiant moon illuminated the countryside around us: stone and dust and here and there a house or tree.  Two Italians from [[L1983]] gave me a ride back to the hotel, and maybe it was the two bottles of wine we had shared, but the silence on the way back felt good and the music still haunts me.

Happy New Year.
Ruin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When the Arabs swept into northern Africa in the 11th century, they not only destroyed the last vestiges of the great Roman desert farming systems, but they also drove the Berbers into the desert.  These Berbers manages to carve and construct entire towns out of rock cliffs, and established “ksars” above to protect their grain and offer refuge. A system of dams across the narrow necks of large rainwater catchment areas created the conditions to support agriculture and feed the town.  Douiret is one such town.
{{4923|center}} 
Ruins of this extensive development cover the hill to the left, but also follow a seam of softer stone around an entire valley.  Houses are partly dug into the softer material, and fronted with masonry construction that supports the opening. I was amazed at the extent of the construction, now completely abandoned.

The architectural highlight of this area is the ksars, one of which hosted the New Year's party I attended. One ksar being renovated into a hotel is Ksar Ouled Debbab:

Chenini is the remnants of another town.

As if living off a corpse, the few residents of Chenini still making their home there seem to get by on the tourists that come to see a world-class archeological site.  What I found was a decaying pile of rubble festooned with electrical wiring, plastic flotsam, trash and the usual handicraft stands.  People do still live there, in what little is habitable, but there are not enough of them to make this a vibrant town and too many to call this a park or monument.  I sensed no pride in the vast effort it must have taken to build this place from stone in the 11th century, nor embarrassment that it is so utterly left to both neglect and the ad hoc infrastructures of modern life.  Instead, in the aggressive approaches by the guides, and the pleading of the children for a dinar or just a caramelo, I experienced only opportunism and desperation.

I cannot resent their need and desire to make a living, but do wish them the resources to take a decisive step: abandon and preserve, or reoccupy and renovate.  Either way would support them better than the unhappy mess that supports them so tenuously today.
Existential Despair (short-lived)                                                                                                                                                                                                                               5pm Permission denied to enter the restricted zone to the south, and forced to head northwest to another crossing into [[L5]].  I’m angry at the official denial, embarrassed by how much I counted on getting permission, annoyed at the time and money I’ve wasted coming down here only to be denied, reluctant to backtrack, frustrated by my inability to craft a substantial petition in French, concerned about what I’ll run into in northern [[L5]], and finally, focused on what is now my only available route to [[L5709]]: the road that caught my attention 28 years ago.

Around me tourists of various nationalities, all here on a comfortable tour bus or in organized expeditions, all here with friends and family, all quite comfortable with what they will see and what they expect and how they will return to their normal life, if they even feel they have left it.  The contrast leaves me in utter despair.

Why do I feel I need to do this?  Why don’t I just go home?  Why am I putting my family through this?  What could I possibly get out of this except pain and misery and loneliness?  A tan? A workout?

6pm Polly on the phone: her jokes totally ruin my funk.  I hate that.

7pm Two American women, mother and daughter, and their Tunisian guide invite me to dinner, and it helps immensely.  The Tunisian is a professor of history with a wonderful sense of humor, and the women have traveled widely, so that our discussion goes from Roman agriculture in the Sahara to riding busses in [[L100]] to coyotes eating the pet dog in Napa Valley where the family grows wine.  A Canadian woman stops by to say hello, mentions she is renting a house in Douz, and says yes when I invite myself to lunch in a few days.  Something to look forward to.

8pm.  Plotting the new route.  I'll tack west much further north that I had originally intended, but I have to backtrack 120km.  I'll wake up at 5am and try to do that in one day, back to [[L5691]] and the Oasis (pink bathroom) hotel.

Awesome name, and I was really looking forward to checking this place out.  Unfortunately, no one seems to think it actually exists: there is absolutely nothing but sand between [[L5711]] and [[L5713]]...oh, and 2 trees.

Deserted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The crossing between Assamaka and [[L5713]] is the most featureless desert I have ever experienced.  30 minutes after leaving Assamaka the guides stopped their car and demanded more money now that we were tagging along.  The wind was driving sand over the ground, visibility was poor, and I suppose the threat of getting lost may have had some merit.  We told them to get lost, and they did, and we were left to cross alone.  The fact that they would abandon someone like that over a few euros left quite an impression on me.
{{6635|center}}So...I've been away from home way, way, way too long!!!

In fact, the piste is pretty easy to follow, with few diversions and alternatives.  We got bogged in the sand only twice, and though adjusting tire pressure to match the circumstances is a time consuming project, we made reasonable time.  We stopped once to greet a couple of trucks we had seen leaving Assamaka and now stopped for lunch, but again the crews had rocks in their hands when we approached and we kept the interaction short (!!!!)  The two [[L2069]] Land Cruisers with machine guns mounted on the truck beds filled with soldiers we had seen earlier were long gone and no help.
{{6638|center}}Uranium tailings at [[L5713]]

The sun set on the surreal mountains of uranium tailings from the mines at [[L5713]], and we entered the town in darkness.  Low, dark, teeming with people, it is impossible to understand or to convey an image from such a drive-through.  We asked for the road to [[L5716]], rolled up to a police post, and were told that we could go no further.  Three policemen and five Tuareg had been killed the night before in a gun [[L5471]] either on the road or in Ifraouine along the way.

We camped at the police post, I beat Wolf at chess yet again, and we were allowed to proceed early the next morning after paying 200 euro for road usage in [[L161]].  When we discovered the paved road closed for resurfacing, Wolf ignored the diversion sign and continued on the road bed until a [[L2069]] pickup truck with armed guard and some very upset road engineers accosted us and demanded a fine.  Again Ahmed intervened, somehow convincing them that though we had indeed sinned, the exorbitant amount we had paid to drive on that road certainly demanded some consideration.  After some heated debate we were allowed to proceed, on the dirt side road this time.  Just 2 kilometers further the roadwork ended and we were back on pavement.

It is small and low and not at all grand, the famous mosque made of mud brick vying for the skyline with antenna masts and water towers.  The campground a few kilometers out of town has seen better days, and perhaps the city is similarly in decline.  There are beggars in the streets, gatherings of huts within the city limits, goats and motorcycle taxis everywhere.

Tourists, too, are just starting to come back.  The civil war in [[L5]] and the Tuareg revolt here in [[L161]] interrupted the travel business for more than 10 years, though there were some foreigners here even then. I met an American family from [[L540]] here 33 years translating the bible into Tamachek, and a French couple organizing “little projects”.

I met a Dutch industrial designer working with a cooperative of 400 basket weavers, developing a product that would sell better in the European market than the baskets they make now.  I thought: here perhaps was a project that could really make a difference.  Unicef is here, USAID is here…there are German and French projects as well.  I am not here long enough to understand everything that is going on.

Thinking about the Sahara leaves me somewhat conflicted: fighting all that sand would have been a grim affair on a bicycle, though I feel that I was pretty well prepared.  I miss the towering satisfaction my original plan would have brought, but know I had a much more enjoyable experience by truck and with friends.  Wolf Gaudlitz left this morning for Ouagadougou, however, and Ahmed left yesterday for home in [[L5904]].  It all feels like a dream already, I've bought a little satchel of powerful gris-gris to hang around my neck, and after a few days of relaxation I am ready to move south.

All-nighter with Nassirou                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       {{6789|center}}
I was sitting there by the side of the road considering how I might cut down the height of the nubs on this fat tire so that my wheel would fit, when all that gris-gris I bought in Agadez kicked in and a very big, very empty, lots of room for the bike Orange truck pulled up, the first in a very long time.  Nassirou Aboubacar popped his head out of the window and said something like “What ya doin”?  I explained my problem, and he offered me a ride to Abalak.  I accepted.
{{6790|center}}
I had a steel frame for exactly this reason: any old welding shop on earth could fix it if necessary.  Unfortunately, nothing doing in Abalak: weekend, off visiting someone, might be back in a few days, I have no idea what because my French is…poor.  No bike shop to buy a different tire either.  I bought eight very cold coca-colas and we headed for Tahoua.  It got dark.  I looked at Nassirou, he looked at me, and we decided I would stick with him until Konni.  
{{6791|center}}
We got to Konni at 1am.  The streets were totally alive with people and music and traffic of all sorts, but it felt like a village.  I asked if we shouldn’t grab some food (my treat), but he said: “later”.  I asked if he was spending the night where we were parked and he said: “Autre cote”.
{{6794|center}}
Nassirou got on the cell phone and made 10 or 12 calls.  After 20 minutes a man pulled up on a motor scooter and held a brief discussion before taking off.  More phone calls and another 20 minutes went by before two guys rolled a barrel up to the truck.  Two other guys brought pails.  While Nassirou stood in the shadow of the truck counting a huge wad of cash, these four guys filled the truck up with contraband diesel using the pails.  They were laughing and joking and it didn’t take long, with Nassirou paying off the guy on the motor scooter and signaling that now, it was time for dinner.  All “carburante” comes from Nigeria, the official and the unofficial kind, but there is a 17,000 CFA difference in price between a barrel of either.  I asked Nassirou if the quality was the same, and he shrugged to say “The truck runs”.  Of course it isn’t his truck.
{{6797|center}}
We went to diner in a big hut with wrestling on the television and picnic tables for our convenience.  I told Nassirou I would have whatever he was having (gulp!), and that turned out to be couscous with a side of meat and broth.  I didn’t ask what kind of meat. Water and coca-cola and Nescafe came to the table in the hands of a woman who acted like she had an appointme

I met two young girls dressed alike in pink checked dresses, one blind and the other leading her from passenger to passenger pleaded for money.  A woman in immaculate green satin with matching head dress studiously ignored them, oppressed obviously to be there in the dirty station at all.  I offered meager change, and we got our tickets before crossing the street for a glass of hot “Lipton” with plenty of sugar from a street vendor.

The Africa Express minibus left 20 minutes later, full of passengers.  The seats were just a little to close together for adequate knee space and the busses are designed with collapsible seats in the aisles, an idea I hope the airlines ignore or pay me obscene royalties to implement.  
{{6982|center}}
We drove through a sandy countryside dashed and dotted with trees and anthills, huts and houses.  Signs announced the reserve near Niamey protecting the last giraffes in Niger, but I saw no giraffes.  We passed the airport, then a vast expanse seemingly dedicated to black and white and clear plastic bags, and then a street pressed at the edges with people and street stands before pulling into the dirt lot of the Africa Express “gare” after a two hour ride.  A taxi brought us quickly to the Embassy of Benin, and there I discovered that processing would take 24 hours.  Guetto and I would have to spend the night in Niamey.
{{6978|center}}
Guetto had been complaining about a tooth that was slowly discoloring and causing him great pain, and he told me he wanted to go to the Hopital National to have it looked at.  We again took a taxi, bought bags of sweetened yoghurt at the hospital entrance from a street vendor, and were told to go to the emergency room since we didn’t have an appointment.  Guetto went in and I waited outside.  When he reappeared twenty minutes later it was to tell me that he had to pay 1200 CFA ($2.50) for the visit…which it turned out meant that I would be paying it. Guetto had come along without any money at all.  He got an injection into his gum filled with antibiotics and pain killers, and a prescription that I paid 3500 CFA ($7.00) for, with the very good news that the tooth could probably be saved.

He took me to his sister’s house in the huitieme chateau, the city apparently divided into 10 “chateaux” as well as other “quartiers”.  The streets were wide and unpaved, the house a walled plot, and a forecourt for the ca

They call it the Sahel, but it looked and felt like the desert, only with a few more plants and absolutely flat.  Before he left for Ouagadougou, Wolf Gaudlitz highly recommended I head south to Zinder rather than west to [[L5725]] due to the harsh circumstances, but this only interested me more.  Besides, I really felt I was running out of time and adding a week to the trip to see Zinder felt…irresponsible(?).
{{6786|center}}
For an entire day, the premise of this bike trip was completely fulfilled: solitude, no traffic, decent paving, stark landscape, strong wind at my back.  One day.  Then the paving stopped and it was piste for a long, long time.  Sandy, exhausting piste where the map said pavement.  I thought: “This is actually perfect.  Exactly what I would have faced between [[L5709]] and [[L5713]]”.  So, I persevered in pretty good humor, recalculating the distance in days to [[L5720]], considering how much water I had, and convincing myself that all was well only slower.
{{6795|center}}
Then I blew my rear tire. Deep breath.  I thought: “This is actually perfect.  I haven’t had even close to my ration of flat tires.  I pulled off the road, set up my tent, removed all my baggage, locked up my bike, and went to lock up the trailer when I found one of its tires flat as well.  Deep breath.  I thought: “No problem: plenty of sun left”.  I was still in good humor, hopped in the tent, and calmly fixed both tires.  I couldn’t find what might have caused the punctures but that isn’t so unusual, and I went to sleep feeling well prepared for the next day.  I was a little shocked by the state of my rear bicycle tire, which was actually quite shredded and left the inner tube exposed in a number of places, but I figured it might hold me until I got to [[L5725]].  Wrong.
{{6788|center}}
The next morning I found both patched tires once again flat.  I had failed to find a thorn in the trailer tire the night before.  The bike tire turned out to have multiple punctures.  I lined my helmet with the raincover to the trailer, poured in some of my precious water, and discovered 2 additional holes I hadn’t found the night before by listening alone.  One old patch was leaking as well.  I patched everything very nicely, walked all my stuff out of the stand of thorny trees I had camnped in to avoid further puncture, and got on the road.  For about a kilometer.  The back tire was completely shredded and it would no longer support the tube
Utopia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When I awoke it was to a sideways view of a bustling street filled with small stands and street vendors and truck drivers.  Nassirou waited for his patron to arrive (“I drove all night to get here on time, and he’s still sleeping with the cell phone off”!), and I went to a bike shop with my bike to inquire about a file; a big metal file I could use to eek out just enough space for my tire.  I only needed to remove about a quarter inch of what amounted to a threaded sleeve sticking out from the misplaced crossbar in order for the wheel to fit.  The bike guy didn’t have a file but he took me to the welding shop across the way and through a gate and across a vacant lot.  I thought: “OK, wait a minute.  I could just buy a smaller tire”.  I communicated my thoughts badly.  I turned my back for a couple of minutes to talk to the bike guy, and the welder simply removed the protruding metal sleeve while I wasn’t looking. It was that quick.  My bike was fine, the fat tire works, all is well, but I think I’ll have the folks at Independent Frames take a look at the frame geometry when I get back.

I thanked Nassirou for his tremendous kindness, turned down the offer to continue on to [[L5854]] with him, took his picture and promised to send him a copy and then rode off to find a hotel.  Within minutes of leaving Nassirou, I met Sonteijmane Gorba, but that’s a bit of a mouthful and his friends call him Guetto.  After 5 days together I now comfortably count myself among those friends.

Because I hadn’t called since leaving [[L5716]] and it was too early to do so at the moment, I wanted to send Polly and Mia an email before I found a hotel and went to sleep.  I asked randomly for an internet café and when I found it closed was taken in hand by the sign painter across the street, the aforementioned Guetto. His boss called a friend who had a computer at home, and Guetto led me all the way across town to his house, waited outside while I sat in the living room and wrote my messages, and then led me even further to a hotel where he though I would be comfortable.

He told me to come visit after I had slept, but I was so disoriented that it was only by accident that I rode my bike past his studio the next day, where he waved me over to say hello.  He decided to give me a tour of the vicinity by bicycle, and this is how I got the opportunity to visit Darey Malki, a utopian agrarian community started in 1953 by two idealistic friends.

I awoke to find everyone asleep around me and climbed up to the roof for some air.  The American embassy was having an evacuation drill, a taped voice ordering everyone to stay away from the windows.  Doves cooed in the trees, and I heard squeaking and wailing from lizards and goats.  I could hear American kids on a swing set just behind a nearby wall, and realized I really missed home.  The others awakened as the sun etched away at the haze, and for a while I listened to the drone of their conversation below.

Lauren agreed to give us all a tour of the city in his car, and I bought him some gasoline.  At almost $2.00/liter it was the least I could do.  The scale of the city is nothing like I expected, exactly as in [[L5716]].  There are large buildings, they are spread far apart, and I never felt any sense of urbanity at all.  The Kennedy bridge (photography not allowed!) is…just a bridge.  The railings were lined almost entirely with drying laundry.  I had always imagined my first view of the River [[L161]] would be more momentous.

The visa was unexpectedly ready exactly when promised at the embassy, Lauren got us to the gare on time, there was place left on the minibus for Guetto and I, we wished Lauren success with his house and his family and his cash flow, and just like that we were gone.  There were still no giraffes visible in the reserve.  I came back to my hotel room three hours later to find the locks forcefully removed with obvious damage to the steel door and everything wide open.  The hotel staff was in a flurry.  The police chief arrived.

I had not returned the night before, and the hotel staff didn’t know if I was in the room or not: it was they who had forced the lock.  I never imagined I had walked off with the only key, I was insensitive to the idea that my unexpected delay in [[L2276]] might concern the hotel, and I certainly never imagined that my disappearance would be reported all the way up to the governor.  The chief was there, I believe, to make sure I paid for the door.  Nothing was stolen, nothing was lost, and the repairs cost me 3000 CFA ($6.00) as far as I can tell at this writing.  I’m still apologizing to absolutely everyone for the “derangement”.
Hunger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          {{6973|center}}Sahelian Niger experienced food shortages as recently as 2 years ago, and I looked to World Hunger, Twelve Myths by Frances Moore Lappe, Joseph Collins and Peter Rosset (Grove Press, 1998) for some understanding of the issue.  I learned the following surprising facts:
1.	Food is abundant.  78% of all malnourished children under five in the developing world live in countries with food surpluses.  Countries like India and Brazil with massive malnourishment export large quantities of food.  Countries like Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Mali have many times more farmable land then is actually utilized.  The real issue is not scarcity.  The issues are third world debt incurred to pay for dubious projects serving established elites to the exclusion of majority interests, subsequent pressure to raise and export cash crops to the exclusion of local food supply to pay down foreign debt, and war fueled by superpower geopolitical meddling.  
2.	Droughts do not cause famine: they are simply the last straw.  The real problem is increased vulnerability brought about by man-made factors.  All but one Sahelian nation suffering prolonged drought actually produced enough food to feed itself.  Unfortunately, poor farmers in debt to rich farmers and merchants were forced to sell them their production at rock-bottom prices, leaving them without enough food to survive the hunger season.  Purchasing food was impossible because merchants raised their prices in the face of shortfalls.  Debt, not drought, killed the Sahelian peasant.
3.	Population density does not cause hunger, poverty and inequality does. World population growth rates are actually plummeting.  In Africa, fertility peaked in the early sixties and has dropped ever since.  That decline is expected to accelerate.  Hunger and high fertility rates coexist primarily where societies deny security and opportunity to the majority, and deny education to women.
4.	Desertification may best be addressed by population increase, not decrease.  Marginal soils require irrigation, terracing, intensive crop and livestock rotations and incorporation of organic matter.  This takes a lot of labor: success of these strategies has historically depended on population densities approximating 110 people/square kilometer, while sub-Saharan Africa in 1995 recorded approximately 24 people/square kilometer.
5.	Pesticides, originally intended to increase farm yields have fed a cycle resulting in financial and ecological ruin.  By destroying natural population control among insects, and t

So much water was very…soothing.  People like Mungo Park died finding and charting it's course it is said, but when you realize it really is just a river you also come to understand they did so for reasons all their own.

I spent my first night out of [[L6034]] still in [[L161]], in a Germa village named Makani after I got an especially nice hello from a guy on the highway.  I screeched to a stop and asked him if I couldn’t pitch my tent within the walls, but he had to summon Douwda Noma to communicate in French.  Douwda is a young guy who went to work in Lome and picked up some French there.  He arranged everything, showing me where I could place my tent and recognizing that perhaps I needed a bit of “repose”.  First they brought me a pillow and a mat and a mattress for under the tent however, since they couldn’t accept that I might sleep on the ground!  I went to sleep for a few hours and awoke to a hazy view of the moon and the sound of pounding mortars (2 or even 3 girls to a pestle), a TV, kids laughing, goats, birds, and crickets.  The Germa sounded like music, a girl hummed a few lines of a song over and over pleasantly, a man issued orders: the sounds all blended like water in a stream, like this was a dream.  
{{7266|center}}
Daouda and posse

I found water and food next to the tent, manioc and onion sauce and couscous and green sauce, and it was too much for me to eat.  A girl told me to save the manioc for morning, and took away the other pots.  Later a younger guy showed me an area surrounded by mud brick where I could wash from a bucket, and then I went back to sleep.  I left a kite for the kids and a little tapestry I had bought in [[L6034]] for the cook, took some pictures of Douwda and the local crew, got an address to send them to, and was back on the road before it got hot.
{{7270|center}}
The [[L161]]

I reached Gaya in early afternoon, and found a store that sold sweetened yoghurt in bags: I can’t get enough of the stuff and downed three.  The road follows the river for a bit and then it was the douane (customs) on the [[L161]] side of the bridge.

The towns all have big shady mango trees, each with benches and gas stations and women selling baskets of food under them.  A gas station is a wooden stand with beautiful bottles of different sizes containing what I thought was tea but what turned out to be diesel: every town has several.
{{7672|center}}Gas Station

In the north the land is corrugated three hills to every five kilometers...take my word on this.  Bicycling was either top gear or bottom gear with nothing in between.  There is a haze to the air, an excretion of the forest perhaps, but also smoke from the production of charcoal.  The air smells faintly of it, and wood is stacked everywhere along the roadside.

My route was expedient but unwise.  Traffic was minimal but almost all trucks, and meeting a truck coming from ahead was like having sand and smoke and diesel fumes literally flung in your face.  The forest is cut back so that there is no shade on the road at all, and the heat after 11am was barely tolerable.  [[L28]] should be explored by bicycle on the back roads I now know, but I plunged ahead on the highway nonetheless.  The highway is narrower than your average American residential street, narrower than two trucks and a bicycle should they all try to pass at once.
{{7274|center}}
I limped into [[L5804]] on a tire going flat, and here I decided to ask if there was a church where I could plant my tent.  The pastor was away at a conference, and the woman I talked to wasn't prepared to help me.  Orou Adamou A. Roufaye came to my rescue, volunteering his father's home for a refuge.  It turns out he is the son of the Most Important Man in Town, the house was concrete, and he was happy to have me pitch my tent on his front porch.  Orou took me off for a drink, I met some old guys and treated them to a stiff one, and then we all went to the football game.  The good guys won.
{{7273|center}}
Afterwards I met Orou's wife (I thought he was too young for that, but I hadn't yet shifted from my [[L161]]/[[L5]]/[[L222]] mentality), and then went to his mother's house for some food.  It was fish, and it looked appalling, and for the first time on this trip I seriously considered excusing myself from the proceeding.  Then I ate the darned stuff and it was fine.

Orou needed to talk to me about his business ideas, and whether I had the "force", the power, to help him buy a car so that he could start a taxi service in his town.  He also wanted to start a boutique selling per
Beauty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I got no more than 10 kilometers when a pothole popped my left trailer tire just outside a schoolhouse.  As if I had stepped on a beehive, the kids came swarming out to greet me, clustering around me in a dense ring and touching and prodding and shoving to get a view.  Teachers appeared, order was restored, I fixed my third flat of the day, I took a school portrait to send them when I get back, and then I got back on the road.  I was tired, and it wasn't noon.

I got to N’Dali feeling rather unwell, asked for an auberge and was led off into the woods by a taxi-moto to the Centre d’Accueil et de Formation Gusunon Keru, created by the Catholic Diocese de N’Dali.  It turns out that here in the forest at N’Dali is a national center offering a 20,000 volume library, a computer center, internet access, conference facilities, housing and secretarial services.
{{7281|center}}
A room was available for not very much, they made me a stupendous dinner of salad, rice, chicken and papaya, and they opened up the TV room so I could catch up on [[L28]] news.  I told myself I wouldn’t eat chicken on this trip, but then I told myself lots of things.  A slightly deformed young man who didn’t say a word snuck in to sit next to me and I [[L1692]] the dinner with him.

I sat in on the evening service, held at dusk in a small gated garden in front of a large display of Notre Dame de N’Dali.  Multicolored lighting made a flamboyant spectacle at her feet, dimming the swirl of orchids above.  Perhaps 25 people sat on benches on three sides of the perimeter, young sisters dressed in brown robes, a pastor in more ornate regalia, a brother and lots of kids.  I heard birds and motorcycles and people outside the walls.  The sisters started singing, a call and response in the clearest and most beautiful voices, something simple and exquisite in this wild place, fragile but resolute to the masculine harangue from the loudspeakers at the mosque in the village.  I was exhausted from the day, I was not myself, I was reduced to quiet tears.  I do not believe they knew the beauty of their effort, but I know I have never witnessed a more beautiful mass.

Gris-Gris                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had planned a more heroic ending to this trip, but here’s what really happened; perhaps it’s more befitting anyway:
{{7285|center}}
I was unwell when I arrived in N’Dali, the room I got was in a concrete building that slowly roasted me all night so that I did not sleep, and I could barely stay on my bike for the 60 kilometers into [[L1074]].  After more than 2 months of culinary receptivity and constant but controllable diarrhea, the inner me had had enough and took charge.  I spent a second night awake and on the toilet, looked in the mirror for the first time in weeks, and found an exhausted guy I barely recognized frowning back at me.  He was not having fun anymore.  
{{7287|center}}
I had known this for some time now, since it became hard to match the enthusiasm of literally every town I passed through on my bicycle, all of whom left me feeling like a sports super star even when I was primarily preoccupied with keeping my underwear dry, and since meeting Woru Noel Siraru and being given a tour of a radio station under construction 30 kilometers north of [[L1074]] but feeling uncharacteristically disinterested.  I wrestled with what to do all night: prolong the trip while I recovered in [[L1074]], or listen to that part of me that said I had gotten what I came for: enough was enough.
{{7289|center}}
The next morning I assembled all my stuff, walked my bike down to the bus station in the dark, and got on a bus for the last 400 kilometers to [[L5854]].  I popped pink pepto-bismols, two every hour, and kept my fingers crossed, arriving to the beat of some great west African drums and electric guitar.
{{7292|center}}
I realized as I was packing that somewhere between N’Dali and [[L1074]], perhaps at the Catholic center or at the radio station, but probably on the road somewhere, I lost the little leather satchel filled with medicinal herbs held around my neck by a twisted leather string that I had bought in [[L5716]], [[L161]] from Aboubacar Mahamadou.  I had lost my gris-gris.

Kids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Unquestionably the most inspiring people I met on this trip were the kids, and I sat next to a wonderful French woman on the bus to [[L5854]] here to adopt two of them.  She felt a little too old to deal with diapers, and understands that 3 to 4 year olds adapt easily, so that is the age of the kids she will soon call her own.  It takes over a year to finalize an adoption, but she hopes and expects for everyone’s sake that she will get to take them home to [[L79]] sooner.

Nadine Frouin has been building a house on the coast of [[L28]] for 10 years now, a little at a time as money allowed, and will one day make it her home.  I liked very much the notion that her children will one day return to the country from which they came, and I hope Nadine never recovers from Mal d’Afrique.  I told her I might very well be cured.
Africa                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          National Geographic magazine opened my eyes to Africa as a kid and that INFECTION has been a gentle nudge in the back of my mind ever since.  It’s a common problem, there is no known cure and I’ve heard the more serious condition referred to as Mal d’Afrique.

When I was 19 years old and terribly unhappy at Cornell University and completely numb to the possibilities of life, the apparent IMPOSSIBILITY of a trip to Africa became a LIFE PRESERVER for me.  I borrowed $300 from my parents (they expected me back in a month I think), borrowed 2 bicycles from an aunt and uncle in Holland (thanks again Nell!) and with my girlfriend Denise (Hi Denise!) started a year-long trip that finally landed me in Morrocco.  My LIFE PRESERVER became a discreet REALITY, and the reality during the three months I bicycled around that wonderful country finally became an IMPETUS to return home and study architecture.

Africa slowly settled into a DREAM I held for 28 years, and this trip has reawakened me to a continent far more complex and engaging than anything I could have imagined from my earlier trip.  Somewhere around Tamanrasset, after all this time, all these abstract Africas made way for a concrete reality and I finally began to think about this continent more simply as a real PLACE inhabited by real people.

When, then, did this PLACE begin to turn into an EXCUSE?  Assamakka, probably, or Arlit or shortly thereafter.  A French woman on living in Agadez: “Nothing functions, there is no work ethic, but c’est Afrique”!  A Nigeran truck driver on his work schedule: “I travel all over: Burkina, Mali, Ghana, Togo, trips that last sometimes a week or more.  We don’t sleep in hotels, we sleep in the truck or sometimes we don’t sleep at all.  C’est Afrique”!  A young guy with dreams of Europe: “I want to get married.  I want to find a job.  Here there is nothing for me: C’est Afrique”!  The place has become the measure of their collective frustration, a way to rationalize thwarted intentions.

There is even a corollary to this construct, and this is particularly evident in Niger.  There are signs everywhere there, announcing a wide spectrum of NGOs.  For the myriad of foreigners working there, having accepted Africa as an excuse, the PLACE has become a PROJECT.  Family planning, Hunger, AIDS, Water, Desertification, Literacy: all of these issues have foreign advocates and volunteers and money.  There is even some local cynicism about these efforts, since cars and lodging and equipment up to first world standards always seem to prece
Bonsoir, Pussycat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I expected to arrive at L’Etoile Rouge not far from the airport, assemble my bicycle, and head for the Sheraton: on the map, easy to find, internet access, air conditioning, outrageously expensive.  Instead, I met Salissoutour Kassinou.  

Kassinou decided I should NOT pay the outrageous prices at the Sheraton, he knew exactly where I should stay and he would show me a Cyber café. I was in no state to deal with the tour of [[L5854]] I received in his hands, he speeding along on his motorcycle while I did my best to keep up, but he was gracious and eager and true to his word.  He even convinced the guardian of this conference center I am staying in to do my laundry.  I’m stuck here without clothes until the guardian gets back.

This trip has not evolved as planned: No bandits, no thieves (OK...Fouruzi took my jackknife in [[L222]]…$38, plus tax), no tough guys (except for those truckers in the desert and those religious extremists who smashed my headlights in Beni Isguem…no harm and $28), no lions, no tigers, no bears (and no giraffes or elephants either, or snakes or scorpions for that matter).  No major tourist attractions.  Only the friendliest, most helpful, most supportive, most enthusiastic, most INSPIRING people I have ever met.  Not since that little kid yelled "Bonsoir, Pussycat" to me as I chugged into [[L5901]] have I gotten such an incredible lift from the people I passed.  I have seen large and joyous groups of people in these Peule villages actually stand up and cheer a 48 year old white guy with a stupid hat and too much gear, with papayas and peanuts and dates hanging off the back, waving and grinning and yelling “Bonjour” at them.  This was a profound lesson for me on the meaning of unmitigated, unselfconscious joy.

Of course, they may have been laughing AT me…
Back in the Big City !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Riffled back down to Perth…to spend a few more days checking out the big city.
The trip back was the equivalent of Lands end to John O Groats

It really is a fantastic city, not too big, very compact, but has the High Rise look of Docklands in London, but right in the heart of the city centre…its unbelievably clean, has a enormous & impressive river called the Swan, which they make the most of, unlike the rather grim looking River Hull

Friday evening. Just back in Perth, and head up to Kings Park with J&P went up there with some KFC and a couple of beers, to watch the sun set… makes for a great picture.{{4243|left}}{{4245|right}}
Had some drinks out in the garden with some of their neighbours...Ironically one of them looks just like Toadie!

On Sunday I spent some more time with Kannara, we went over to the movies, and saw Borrat. Matt – Great recommendation, I’ve never laughed so much in my life…. that’s probably to do with watching virtually no TV for a month though!

Couple of days later…

I’m up in Perth. And I catch a sightseeing tram begin to regret it immediately, as it seems to be full of 70yr old pensioners…and to make matters worse…the bus driver thinks he’s funny, the only thing worse than that was the pensioners were lapping up his crappy jokes…I got off the tram pretty sharpish… (I can Imagine Helen laughing at that one)
<br>
{{4239|left}}{{4232|right}}
Spent the next day up in Perth centre again…just get back in time to turn the TV on see Hussy riffle off a shot to claim the winning run in the 2nd Test!

Spent Friday day in Fremantle, went to the harbour and went on a submarine! And to check out a Shipwreck exhibition at the near the beach…later I shoot off to the beach with Pascal and go body boarding …Surfs up…I catch a few decent waves, but also get wiped out by an absolute massive ‘un {{4244|right}}

Julie comes to meet us after we’ve finished, and we grab fish and chips on the seafront,
Back to house...Pascal as per usual cracks opens the beers…happy days!

Saturday we go out for some drinks in the evening, have a good laugh; even meet some English people…always good to chat about the football!!

Sunday morning…more Bodyboarding at 8am..most of you lot are still in V Bar…I’m hitting the waves…some excellent conditions make for the best Bodyboarding yet…at a place called Secret Harbour!

Yesterday, head up to Kings Park again, this time with Kannara we took some food up there for lunch, and just chilled out all afternoon in the shade. Late
Bunbury and Bussleton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           [[L5660]] & Bussleton

I arrive in [[L5660]] mid morning and grab the last dorm in the hostel...bit of luck as I hadn't booked !!

after checking in I have a chat with some of the people in the hostel, bit of a mixed bunch, bit of an older crowd than the 20somethings in the previous hostels up the coast, this is pretty much a working hostel so most of the people are there long term as they have jobs in the town, which makes for a good atmosphere in the place as they all have a good laugh with a few beers in the evening. all sorts in this hostel, French, Spanish, Korean, American, Australian..etc...I feel I'm the only English person there baring Jenny from [[L1032]].

After a movie night in the Hostel everyone gears up for the weekly karioke sesh down the local, I sail on down the pub with them, and roll out my crowd pleaser Johnny B Good...a classic from the uni days....Remember those quality Karioke nights at Uni Rich ;-) 

the next day went to the beach with my French room mate Xavier, went for a snorkel, but didn't see much, so just ended up swimming !
{{4564|left}}

Pool competion in the evening crashed out in the 2nd round though...no suprise there !

Next day up early doors, went down to the beach with Jenny to see the Dolphins, as they came in early each morning, bit like at Monkey-Mia up the coast.

chilled on the beach after that, and cooled down with a swim !

{{4580|left}}{{4573|right}}

Got pretty wasted in the evening a cheap bottle of wine, then a few beers playing pool in the pub finished me off, cant remember getting home !! 

Next morning jumped on the bus...adios [[L5660]] !

<B>Busstleton..</b>

The shocker...checking into to this hole is not exactly what I had in mind, what are Lonely planet thinking, they make this place sound tip top,  using words such as "comfy", "cozy", "welcoming"...yeah for the Mice maybe !!

but as the old chestnut goes..."Its not where you are its who your with" and I was with about 10 Japanese people in this place......a bit overwhelming at first, but basically I've never met a group of people who made me feel part of their well established group so quickly.

{{4571|left}}{{4576|right}}
within half an hour I was rocking up to the beach with them and was swimming about in the amzing sea down there, we swam out to the jetty and dived off, having a great time, wanted some pictures of that, so went back, walked back down the pier with my camera, and got these...I had such a good time this afternoon !

I remember a time when flying fascinated me, and I could sleep on a flight. No more.

Air [[L79]] charged me $125 extra to send my bicycle. Could have been worse...

The TSA allows one quart-size clear plastic ziplock bag filled with containers each holding no more than 3 ounces of liquid, as long as this bag is not concealed. A tube of Tom’s toothpaste holds 6 ounces: who knew? They confiscate my toothpaste in [[L3257]], and to get my sunblock through I go through the entire wait-in-line-for-10-minutes-remove-shoes-and-coats-expose-laptop-and-all-other-electronics-pass-through-metal-detector-answer-innocuous-questions routine twice.

Dinner menu:

I watch a French movie about a French president corrupted by power: I think it ends with him considering the murder of his own daughter to protect his agenda. My French is exceptionally bad. The movies are unedited for content: no American prurience regarding what your kids see on the screen of the stranger sitting next to them. 

When [[L1590]] arrives, it is as lights in the darkness outside, surprisingly close. It looks just as [[L3257]] did when we left, and for the briefest moment it feels like coming home. It isn’t [[L1590]], anyway, but suburb after suburb until we touch down.

At Charles de Gaulle I suddenly discover that I’m booked on a different flight for [[L2642]] then I purchased over the internet, and that my 8 hour layover is now only an hour. I was watching my bike box and my toothpaste tube instead of my ticket, I guess. 
Sleep                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The sun rises as I board the flight for [[L2642]], and when we land it is without my bicycle. The one I paid $125 extra to send…I guess I forgot to pay for it to arrive. It is overcast and cold here.

My fluent Arabic comes in handy as I describe a very large cardboard box containing a very important toy.  Everyone is very nice, and the bike will be here at 7pm.  I find a very entrepreneurial cab driver…well, he finds me…and I overpay him to get me to the hotel, where the room smells vaguely of unwashed toilets.  The promised internet access is unavailable.  I call my wife and discuss my day with her answering machine.

Sleep.  The fact that I just left the two girls I love the most for this hare-brained adventure won’t feel as awful in the morning, but it certainly does now.

Sleep.


Surfs up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I Arrive in Dunsbourgh, hoping the hostel is a better bet than before...but if the Hostels were Football teams this would be Liverpool, making the previous hostel Macclesfield...

What a choice for Christmas, this place is the business, I could actually live here !! its big, clean, full of cool people who are also staying till Xmas, has Skysports, free bodyboards, and the back garden meets the beach...Ideal...

Spent 9 days here, have just left Dunsbourgh, and had the best time possible, I was gutted to leave the place, everyone was so friendly & chilled....well and truly had the time of my life !!

{{4764|left}}{{4754|right}}

Spent Most of my time with Adam, Heather, Bobby, Will, Debs, and Mikeo..

{{4784|left}}{{4783|right}}

Anyway...Most days we would jump into the car and roll down to the surf beachs either Smiths or Yells early doors around 8, as Adam had to be at work for 12, so we'd get chance to catch some decent waves before lunch....

{{4758|left}}{{4757|right}}

That left the afternoon free to chill out, in the hamock or watch a DVD...or in Wills case..sleep all afternoon !

{{4766|left}}

One afternoon we pilled down the beach and went to Yallinup for the first time, the surf was of this world...never seen anything like it....didnt stop Me, Adam and Bobby from getting wiped out big time on some killer waves. Miko and Heather got no further than getting their feet wet ! dont balme them really !!

{{4767|right}}

The next day Dave took us on a tour of the cape, where we got to see the dolphins again, Heather just saw them diving through the waves as we were driving away, an amazing sight, almost better than seeing them up close  they were better at catching the waves than us !!

Surf master Dave then took us back down to Smiths beach where we tried to learn to surf, Bobby, Heather and Myself had a go out on a long board...didnt really get it though, Heather was trying to show us how to stand up on the board, but kept falling off herself ! some teacher :-) we just got back on the bodybords for some user friendly action !!

Ruth and Lauren gave it a miss...I think they thought it was too cold..ha..ha

That day evening we had the BBQ at the hostel, and discovered our cheapo way of drinking, value box's of wine...5 littles for $10 thats about 4 quid !! ha-ha we got lashed !!

Christmas kind of crept up on us, as there is not much of a build up here, like back home..so before we knew it it was Xmas Eve, but it was just another day down the
Smell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Still here...sleep and open windows do wonders.  Thanks for your comments: they really make my day.  I woke up to the smell of the hotel soap I used last night (fabulous), and stepped outside to the smell of [[L3083]] trees in full fruit (wow!).  Jump into an ocean of perfume, swim to the bottom, and then swallow until you are ocean inside and out: that was the smell of [[L3083]] trees.

The bicycle arrived as promised: intact and, with minor adjustments, running beautifully: thank you, thank you, thank you to John and Larry at Pedal Power in Acton, [[L519]], with kudos to the folks at Independent in [[L3268]] as well: this bike rocks!  

I did have a frantic 20 minutes (20 minutes!!!  You think you know 20 minutes?  Pay $2,000 to fly to a foreign country where you don't speak the language to find that you might have come for nothing: then you'll know 20 minutes!!!) looking for the pedals in my bike bags, thinking I'd left them at home, thinking honestly that it would be quite typical of me, thinking of the incomparable hassle I would face in finding the same clip species here as my Algerian visa slowly expires...but no, pedals found, trip intact.

Here's Adel: former boxer, husband, father of 2 girls, my cabdriver to the airport to pick up the bike.  He charged me half of what I paid yesterday, shared some great political cynicism, gave me his phone number and told me to call.  Instead, he's immortalized here.

{{4611|center}}
Here's George Bush.  I think he went to the same barber I did.  He may be missing some teeth as well...maybe he hasn't been flossing.

Things I wish I'd packed:
1. Dental floss (can't find the damn stuff anywhere!)
2. French dictionary (I keep blubbering in Spanish)
3. Arabic dictionary (just kidding)

Considerations while grocery shopping:
1. What packs more densely: spaghetti or macaroni?
2. What cooks faster and uses less fuel: rice, spaghetti or vermiccelli?
3. What the hell do you add to rice/spaghetti/vermiccelli for flavor?
(answers at the end, and no peeking)

Met two motorcyclists back from the desert.  Here's more or less what they were carrying:
(spare parts, gps, satellite phone, clean underwear).
Here's my stuff:
(tent, sleeping bag, pad, stove, gps, satellite phone, laptop, 2 cameras, tripod, solar collector, transformer, 2 spare tires, 2 inner tubes, bike tools, chess set (couldn't resist), maps, more maps, windbreaker, 4 wool hats (don't ask), bike helmet, 3 sets of clothes, long underwear, 2 eyeglasse

Merry Christmas!

Tonight's menu:
1. pate du canard with figs and fruit sauces (very, very nice improvement on plain old pate)
2. consomme de...some seafood...
3. [[L224]] rolled around some kind of leafy vegetable: indescribable and great
4. creamed potato tower: think whipped cream, only potato...
5. custard with chocolate lines drawn on it, and english pudding
6. cafe au lait

I showed up so late, they gave it to me for 1/3 of the price, which, because I'm stingy as all hell except when I'm not, naturally quadrupled my pleasure.

Bonne nuit Mia.

Solitude                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        End of a day of shopping:
1. Electrical tape: Larry, the handlebar wrap just isn’t holding up at the bar end.
2. Scrubbie/sponge: Lots more cooking happening soon.
3. Wool socks: At least, the guy said they were wool…
4. Knife: From the cutlery bin at the department store.
5. Corkscrew/can opener/bottle opener/mini knife: Just like I lost….only...different.

I took the Polly Dithmer approach to shopping: see something more or less like what you need, and grab it.  No exhaustive survey of the marketplace, no price comparisons, no research regarding alternative models, nothing.  I’m a new man.

Tried to find the Quaran in English, but only found Newsweek.

Found a Polartech burnoose (Polartech! Manufactured in Lawrence, [[L519]]!  The guy told me wool was too heavy and impractical!), perhaps as an alternative to some kind of additional blanket or comforter, but couldn’t convince myself it was quite right.

Here’s the bottom line on traveling alone, at least for me: it’s fine in the morning as long as you have an agenda in place (ride 100km, buy wool socks, whatever), but it is terribly painful in the afternoon as the light dwindles.  I miss familiar things and people.  I miss my family and friends.  I physically ache for connection.  By the time it gets completely dark, I feel reduced to a client, a target or an outcast, depending on the situation.

Travel: it's a mental game.

Wine Region !!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  27-29 Dec

Moving on anywhere after Dunsbough was going to be a hard act to follow, & [[L5662]] with all its hype was no exception.

Didn’t think to much of the place at first, your based in the town and its simply one long street of tourist style shops and pubs, your 10k from the beach, and the “[[L5662]]” is nothing more than a small stream!

{{4876|left}}
So its not going to blow you away like some of the other places on the coast or in the forest.

They were pushing wine tours at the hostel as the place is [[L12]]’s famous wine region, but as that’s no fun on your own, I didn’t bother.

Spent the day wandering around didn’t get up to anything interesting...and didn’t meet any interesting people in the hostel, apart from one English guy, who I watched some of the cricket with until his nagging wife dragged him away !! : Note to self!

Saw the beach on the way into the area though as the bus stops their briefly and we had chance to check it out, and its the West Coasts No.1 surfing location, you could tell that back up the road in Dunsbourgh/[[L5878]] but down here the waves are even bigger.
{{4875|left}}{{4873|right}}
<br>
Didn’t get chance to sample the waves personally just shot them from the shore this time!

The next day got ready and moved on to [[L5663]] where I was to meet up with Kannara again for a few days, So I waddled out of the hostel with my ever increasing luggage…I need to ditch some stuff.
{{4874|left}}
Happy New Year !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                29 Dec -2 Jan

Arrived in [[L5663]] to find the Baywatch YHA…expected to see the Hoff running the place, but no such luck!!

I get here before Kannara, So check in, Check it out, grab some food, the Youth Hostel has won best Hostel in [[L12]] every year since 1997 so you know its going to be good!
It’s more like a hotel compared to some places.

I cooked us steak which she rated at only 6/10!! The cheek!!

The next day checked out these famous wineries as [[L5663]] is so close to [[L5662]], We went to a few, and a few wines, they taste so much better than some of the rats pi$$ we’d been drinking the week before in Dunsbourgh. Checked out a few of them and a brewery in the area, The Bootleg Brewery…which did some great beers! But all this alcohol was a bit much in the afternoon! Spent some of the late afternoon at Hamlin Bay!!

{{4881|left}}{{4877|right}}

Took a forest drive felt like the absolute middle of nowhere they could have filled Return of the Jedi here, Kept thinking the Ewoks were going to come crashing threw the trees !

{{4892|left}}{{4891|right}}

Even more wine first thing! Bought my first bottle of decent wine at Hamlin’s! Superb!….Mum; Ones in the post!

Then a afternoon on the beach, we found one called “cozy corner” its not so cozy on the 6km unsealed road to find it !

{{4882|left}}{{4883|right}}

Worth it when we got there, hardy anyone else there, was really nice with loads of mini islands a few hundred of meter into the sea, made for good snorkeling, although my mask is pretty crap think I need a new one!

Spent New Years Eve in the hostel with some of our wine, can’t believe how quiet this hostel was, It was more of an old peoples home, compared to the Holiday style resort of Dunsbourgh over xmas.

But that didn’t matter as we had a great time anyway, Had a really cool time here and a really good laugh, but it was a good job we had the car here, as you need to drive a bit to see the bits and pieces!

{{4889|left}} {{4888|right}}

Anyway the next day, checked out the lighthouse, and the point at which the two oceans meet, you can see the waves crashing against  the rock in different directions so you can see the exact location, was hoping t would have been a calm bay so I could have swam across two oceans…but far too choppy !

{{4885|left}}{{4890|right}}

After Lunch Kannara had to shoot back up to Perth, So I was home alone, Literally, felt like I was the only one there after that, but was moving on first thing in the morning so hit the sack early doors as I
in the Forest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   So [[L5883]]… 2nd-4th Jan

Its basically the furthest inland ive stayed so far, its based in the middle of the Blackwood forest, a little town about pop 400.

The place I stayed  was called the Black Cockatoo and is an “Eco Retreat” with no internet or TV it’s a hippy’s paradise, there is a huge organic garden, and its very green !

{{4984|left}}

It wasn’t like the other hostels I’d stayed  in, I was pretty much the only backpacker, there was a hypnotist with his 5 yr old daughter, a weird bloke who looked like Bad guy from Ghostbusters 2 and he had this spaced out hippy in tow, couldn’t figure them out, He said they were friends, but they seemed very odd, but harmless…

An enormous old English guy, who was an ex chef and basically lived there, he insisted on cooking everyone’s meals…fine by me !

And then a couple of friends from [[L1031]], who drove over during their Uni summer break… 
Lucy and Duncan, they were sound, I went out on the Blackwood River with them in some Canadian kayaks which was great, even though it was a fairly cool day.

{{4981|left}}
<br>
We also found a massive spring water pool that had eucalyptus trees all around it so the water was mixed with that…the area surrounding it smelt amazing!

{{4983|left}} We dived into the pool, which we were later told is bottomless, I kept diving in to try and reach the bottom, but to no avail !

{{4982|right}}

It was really friendly and everyone sat around the fire in the evening having a drink together playing a few games, really different from some of the previous hostels.

This place is very cool, very chilled, it was really relaxing, when I was just hanging about it felt ok to jut laze around, If you get the chance spend the night there…very unique place

Italians!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       {{4921|center}}Meet Luca and Tiziana,  two Italians from [[L1983]] on vacation in southern [[L222]]. I met them New Year's Eve when I was seated at their table, and they were kind enough to let me tag along on their tour of the ksars and villages around [[L5696]].  Luca is an engineer for Mondo (the company that did the athletic flooring for the [[L3196]], and now the Beijing, Olympics)and flies all over the world working on their projects.  Tiziana is a graphic artist for the City of [[L1983]] and doesn't get to fly anywhere.  The drama of these two (She doesn't love me enough!) reminds me of what I like best about Italians, and especially about these two.  They made my stay in [[L5696]] fantastic.
{{4924|center}}
Now, I know everyone is feeling sorry for me out here ("Doesn't this guy have a job"?  "All he does is ride around and take pictures"!  "Didn't I hear he was actually in [[L3029]], [[L505]]"?), so here is the Hotel Sangho, my retreat in [[L5696]], [[L222]].  Boo-hoo me.
Agony                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I was determined to keep my back-tracking to a single day, and set out for the 126 km ride north at 7am from [[L5696]].  The 53 kilometers back to [[L5695]] were done by 11am, and I took an hour in a cafe to drink water, OJ and coffee.  What I didn't notice sitting there was that a ferocious headwind had developed that would punish me for the rest of the day.  It stopped me in my tracks more than once, as the hilly terrain, the oncoming traffic and my own increasing exhaustion took an additional toll.  
{{4927|center}}By 130pm I was in Koutine 1, where the guy standing over the yellow crates sold me the cheapest bottle of water I had found to date, but also kicked in a free pack of gum.  330pm and I was in Arram, where I had been treated to lunch by the Karboub clan: 35 km to go.  It starts to rain.  All day I've been staring at this band of clouds, and now I'm in them.  By 5pm I was in Kettana, and couldn't move anymore.  I had a half hour of daylight left and 20 km to go, but I stopped at a stand selling pomegranates and met Selmi Lamine.
{{4928|center}}Selmi Lamine sold me a pomegranate for (I suspect) the tourist price of .6 Dinar, but he then showed me how to eat the darned thing and then treated me to a coffee as well. As we sat in the cafe, he told me about going back to school to study tourism, that he had almost finished the 2 1/2 year curriculum, and that he would soon start his 2 month internship at a hotel on the island of Jerba.  He speaks English and French and is studying German (very hard, those long German words!), but his job prospects are dismal.  [[L222]] won't let him travel unless he can find a job contract in another country or unless he marries a foreigner.  A story I have heard too often now, and one that makes me fear for this wonderful country.   Isn't this the fuel feeding fundamentalism?  How long before this generation of underemployed students begins to express their dissatisfaction, turning to extremism or violence or hopelessness and self-loathing?  I fear for them.

6pm I turn on my lights and head out into the dark. The wind sucks the breathe out of me, but I'm determined to make it to [[L5691]].  Every time I see on-coming traffic I scoot off the road, but I feel secure that with my blinking lights that I am very visible.  It takes me 2 more hours to get to [[L5691]].  

8pm When I arrive at the hotel I am unable to write my name on the register, and the manager immediately calls for some [[L3083]] juice.  I am in incredible pain, my neck and back having seized up completel

The strength to weight ratio of 853 is close to that of quality titanium frames. A normal chrome molybdenum steel will lose strength in the joints after the heat has been applied.

This material (853) INCREASES in strength as the frame cools to strengths well in excess of the delivered values shown above. This unique air hardening property of Reynolds 853 provides additional stiffness through reduced microyielding at the joints, allowing stiffer frames with excellent fatigue strength (when compared to standard chrome molybdenum) and a superior ride quality from the finished frame. On road and touring frames we recommend the use of 631 or 725 fork blades with 853 frames".

I got that off their website.

This material eliminates the need for butted or double butted tubes and brazing because it is strengthened by the heat of the welding operation, and should a weld ever fail, any old shop in Africa stands a chance of repairing it.  This is why aluminum or carbon or any number of other possible (and possibly lighter) frame materials were not selected.  The frame has holes and braze-ons for every conceivable configuration of component parts in case anything I have now should break and I can't find the same replacement parts.  The forks are extra wide to accept both mountain bike and regular street width tires.

The rear axle is solid steel, not the hollow axle that usually houses the quick release mechanism.  I was concerned about the asymmetric stresses of the trailer, as well as the stress of my 195 pounds and the weight of the bike bags, and so we took this extra measure.

I am using bar-end shifters because they are easy to adjust and repair and replace. There is a cassette of 9 gears on my back wheel, with t

...you get the picture.  To redeem myself I put in a decent if not outstanding 80 kilometers today, pulling into Kibili around 5pm.  Found a decent hotel.  OK, better than decent: waterfalls, swimming pool, deep, hot bath, full bar and internet: $100 including dinner and breakfast.  I'm not exactly slumming it yet, though that time will shortly be upon me.

Early afternoon, [[L5691]].

I had trouble getting money yesterday leaving [[L5691]], and didn't finally pull out until 230pm.  
I had time for 40 km with that headwind still blowing fiercely, though not quite in my face as I turned westward, and pulled into El Hamma at 530, just as it got dark.  2 guys on a small motorcycle shouted some encouragement mid-day as they zoomed by, and then waved me over for a coffee a few hours later.  Boubridaa Abdelhamid and a friend were toking on a waterpipe, and we ended up chatting a bit.  Finally he invited me to go to the bath with him that night, which we did after I set up in a hotel in El Hamma.  I treated him to dinner, though his wife kept calling him on his cell phone, and he was very worried about someone messing with his motorcycle.  I was supposed to meet his family in the morning, but after waiting an hour past our appointed time I took off.  I actually saw him heading towards the hotel several miles up the road, but he didn't see me.  So, no picture, but I have his address and will ask him to send me one.

Abdelhamid is 42 years old, with a lot of metal teeth and some continuing dental problems.  I frankly had my doubts about him when I sat down for a coffee with him, but he proved to be quite genuine.  He's been married 22 years and has 2 sons: a 13 year old who is very studious and a 7 year old who's a bit of a devil.  He worked for the last 6 years in the tourist hotels on the island of Jerba during the week and sees his family on the weekends.  He does this to afford the appliances and plumbing fixtures his wife wants.  He makes 300 Dinar/month working 12 hour shifts.  He built his own house with some good help in only 3 months, and has several friends living with his family, paying rent.  He grew up in [[L5691]] working on the family plot, but switched to the hotel jobs at age 35 because he wasn't making enough money.  For Eid he spent a month salary to buy a sheep, but he say

There was no problem walking on the sand though), I began to see higher land around 4pm.  With the sun starting to set, I was met at 5pm by the Very Strong Headwind, followed at 530pm by the Very Steep Hill, followed at 6pm by the Main Street of Mule Manure.  Exhausted as always at the end of the day (not 19 years old anymore), but spurred on by the kid who yelled BONSOIR PUSSYCAT, I entered [[L5901]] as it got completely dark, turned on the lights and found a sensibly-priced 3 star hotel by 630pm.
{{5281|center}}
The doorman was too chummy, reception was too obsequious, they didn’t have internet, they didn’t accept visa…but still, I thought, all that is less important than a Very Hot Bath and so I signed in.  I entered my room and found it faced a blank wall: new room.  I ran the bath for 15 minutes waiting for hot water: barely tepid.  The doorman ran off to start the second water heater.  We ran all the taps for another 15 minutes: no change.  I grabbed all my bags and the trailer, very politely said I would be staying elsewhere, and headed for the door.  “No, no, just 15 minutes more and it will come, the hot water”!

{{5283|center}}It took me 10 minutes to find another hotel, the Hotel Ksar Rouge, and immediately all was well with the world.  OK, no internet: just a secure wireless network they won’t give out the key for…ugh!  But gracious staff, wonderful facility, great food, and yes: a Very Hot Bath.

Tomorrow, [[L5]].  Visa hassles expected, and then there is this lurking apprehension about the people.  This is a traumatized country I imagine, with years of fundamentalist suppression, Tuareg revolt, rampant unemployment and disaffected youth.  Little news reports come out: “5 policemen massacred near [[L5904]]”.  Foreigners receive armed escorts and live in encampments surrounded by concrete and barbed wire.  There is no tourist industry to speak of lately…and yet…

At least in [[L222]] I’ve inspired such interest and generosity in the people I meet, with the sports thing creating some common ground with the 15-25 set.  I can’t help but believe something similar will happen in [[L5]].  I’m counting on it.

The End?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        All of you still harboring that tiny, secret wish that you were experiencing all this with me, consider this: I spent a long, cold night on a concrete slab seriously considering the possibility that my trip was over.

I arrived at the [[L5]]n border in the early afternoon of the 9th from [[L5901]]: a wonderful 60 km  ride above the Chott El Jerid. The birds infesting the trees within the confines of the hotel were exuberant, the wind was calm, the air temperature cool, the sun hot.  A climb out of [[L5901]] led to gentle downward slopes that allowed me use of the little used larger gears.  

I hope Polly will allow me this small admission, and I sincerely hope it doesn’t affect our relationship:  I am in love with my bicycle.  Light, strong, reliable…rarely complains…it does expect me to do all the work, but that just makes it more adorable and in any case, its for my own good…
{{5202|center}}[[L5954]] 11am
Shortly after the oasis of [[L5954]], the road lost its topcoat and I lost some speed.  The traffic was minimal.  Except for an occasional stand of palms, there was no vegetation whatsoever.  A girl(?) and her son(?) or brother(?) at one point came charging out of nowhere to show me hand-made dolls and necklaces and bracelets, and because I had change I needed to spend before the border and because I needed a good-luck charm to deal with the problems I expected to encounter, I bought a green heart of stone hung by a green string to wear around my neck for the rest of the trip.  The price was 2 Dinar, but she gave it to me for what I had, which was just a bit less.  Mia: its yours when I return, as an addition to our little collection of hearts.
{{5201|center}}Fatma Boucaina, her brother? and her crafts

Then the road got considerably worse: gravel with a spray-coat.  The [[L222]]n border control was somewhat annoying but perfunctory.  They thought the [[L5]]ns might require that I engage a guide, and noted that I had only 6 days left on my [[L5]]n visa, but I said “No problem, I’m just going to find a truck to take me south to [[L5709]] and I’ll be out of [[L5]] in no time”.  Basically, I lied.

The [[L5]]n border post was 4 km down the (very rough) road, and there I was finally stopped cold.  Despite what the [[L5]]n embassy had told me repeatedly before the trip, tourists would under no circumstances pass without a guide.  I wasn’t sure if this was a shake-down or the facts, so I got the [[L5]]n embassy on the phone and asked them to speak to the head of the border control (who, I might add, was pre

It could take a week, and I didn’t want to wait.
{{5910|center}}Listening to Nina Simone the night before departure

I hitched a ride instead with Faysal, a photographer and friend of Said, headed back home to [[L5709]] from [[L1004]] where he had been visiting his wife and kids.  Things apparently hadn’t worked out with his wife, but they were good friends he says.  We left early in the morning for the 400km drive down to El Meniaa and then In Salah, where we would spend the night, Said entrusted with the task of sending my bicycle by bus.

Faysal drove like a man late for a meeting, the 240km took no time at all, and we arrived in El Meniaa before noon.  The town used to be called [[L5905]] under the French, and it is famous for its mineral water, still marketed under the old name.  We discovered however, that no one in town sells bottled water (because…why should they: the mineral water comes out of the taps)!  We filled my water bottles at a gas station.
{{5914|center}}El Meniaa around noon

The only gas station between El Meniaa and In Salah was closed.  Faysal bought a jerry can (they call it that in Arabic as well), filled it at the gas station, and because it didn’t fit in the trunk, sat it on the back seat with all my stuff.  He then pulled out some truly wonderful smoked salmon from [[L21]] out of the trunk for lunch, and we memorably set out for In Salah reeking of gasoline and fish.
{{5911|center}}Looking for jerry cans
Sand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            {{5915|center}}Entering In Salah

The headwind was extremely powerful, and we burned through a full tank and most of the jerry can by 4pm, when we pulled into In Salah; a town, it seems, beset by sand.  I saw huge dunes piled over garden walls, and houses abandoned to the inexorable drifts.  The desert around the town is covered with enigmatic sand mounds, where it turns out they have trucked sand removed from the streets. 
{{5916|center}}In Salah

Faysal drove through the red dirt streets past red stucco houses with light blue doors to find his friends, we had coffee with revered poet Hadj Toumi, and we were invited into the home of Kasem Chermel for tea.  Boubaker was there, playing on the lute, and we were treated to his music video on Kasem’s computer system: three musicians in traditional white garb playing music in the dunes.
{{5912|center}}Boubacar

I liked the music, but possibly only because of the circumstances.  It struck me as incredible that Kasem had achieved this level of quality by recording and mixing in the very room in which we sat, on a not-quite-state-of-the-art computer system, with very limited resources.
{{5918|center}}Kasem on drums, with the inevitable tea.  Visions of asphyxiation from the charcoal burner inside the closed room proved unfounded.

Kasem had also made slide shows highlighting interesting features of the area around In Salah, and so I got the virtual tour of the petrified forest, the hot water springs, a small lake.  I had thought to visit them personally, but Faysal had a schedule: it turned out he actually did have a meeting in [[L5709]] in two days.
{{5917|center}}Kader Hafaoui, Sub-Director Parc Nationale
For dinner we all went to the home of Kader Hafaoui, sub-director of the immense Parc Nationale.  The park covers the entire Wilaya of [[L5709]], approximating the size of [[L79]], and it employs 600 people spread throughout every settlement in the park as wardens insuring the protection of the environment.  It is quite an achievement.  Kader put us up for the night, and in the morning Faysel and I headed south.  We thought we would make it well before dinner.
Flat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Plateau du Tademait surrounding In Salah is as flat as the palm of your hand, and that is where it gets its name in Tamachek.  A black granule lies over red sand stretching far beyond the horizon, and it is tempting through untrained or sensitized eyes to call it “Nothing”.  The black granules disappear south of In Salah, and the color goes to red [[L3083]] beige, but that is the only difference I could detect as we continued on our journey.  The road began to get very bad.
{{5919|center}}
We were 150 km from Arak and traveling at 140km/hr or so, a guess because Faysel’s speedometer was broken, when he shredded the left front tire.  The vibration of the car suddenly sounded louder, we smelled burning rubber, the car began vibrating badly, and Faysal slammed on the brakes and pulled over.  The tire was easily changed, but we had a long way to go without a spare.  I saw slate escarpments to either side of the road, brushstrokes of whispy clouds painting the sky, and a grey overcast at the horizon that turned out to be sand.
{{5920|center}}
At 130 km from Arak the sky turned yellow and the light turned sickly.  Hissing tributaries of sand had been blowing across the road since we started, but now the sand and dust was airborne.  The heat from the sun no longer radiated out into a clear sky, and the car became a sealed sauna.
{{5928|center}}
At 120 km from Arak the visibility shrank to about 1 km.  The dust crept up our noses like an infection and sand crunched in the cups of our teeth.  My snot was all blood and dirt.  Conversation was reduced to “Putain” and “Merde” and sometimes “Putain du Merde”.
{{5921|center}}
At 110 km from Arak the visibility shrank further, to ½ km or so.  The occasional truck loomed black out of the dust, each time requiring some negotiation for asphalt.  The potholes were plentiful and difficult to see.  The wind became a gale pounding the car, and a truck carrying mattresses ahead of us seemed barely to keep its right tires on the road.  Faysal did not slow down, he cursed the trucks that were ruining the roads, and we slalomed along through the potholes, still reeking of gasoline and fish but conscious too of our own nervous sweat.
Near Death Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Faysal is up and the car is packed and the tire is changed in short order, my suggestion that we proceed with more caution is ignored, and we once again bomb down the road at 140km/hr or so, cursing trucks and reeking of gasoline.  The fish smell seems to have abated.
{{5929|center}}Approaching In Ecker

We pull through In Ecker, a doubly fenced in reservation of radioactive stone and dust commemorating the three French nuclear blasts of the early sixties, one of which apparently didn’t stay underground and wiped out several Tuareg villages with exotic pestilence.
{{5957|center}}[[L5907]]

We get an extra tire at In Amguel, a used one made in the [[L71]] for the equivalent of 10 euros, at a garage that hadn’t been open the day before.  Breakfast is an omelette of potatoes much like the tortillas I remember from 28 years ago in [[L205]], only with much more oil, and French fries for the potato bit.  
{{5958|center}}Camels approaching [[L5709]]

The third tire shreds at 100 km from [[L5709]], but now we have that spare.  That spare shreds 20 km later, at 80 km from [[L5709]].  All of this would have cost us half the time if my satellite phone worked, but it is telling me “Account Invalid”.  Faysal stops a car and asks them to call a friend to come get us, which they promise to do when they next get cell service.  He then takes off on the next bus, again with one wheel.  15 minutes later he is back: he forgot his cell phone, but has sent the wheel on ahead with the bus driver, who will deliver it to the right garage for repair.  An hour later Faysal grabs the next bus.  More waiting.  The brain goes numb in the heat, and you quickly lose any creativity or initiative...no, wait...that was the Beck's beer I found under Faysal's seat.

An hour later, three young guys pull up with two new, unmounted tires and spend quite a while wrestling the shredded tire off the wheel.  They are unable to mount the new tire however, and I send them back to [[L5709]] to do it properly.  A few minutes after they leave, the car that Faysal stopped and asked to make a call stops by, reassuring me that they did make the call…and by the way, what happened to the three guys that were supposed to come fix the tire.  Faysal appears an hour later with a mounted tire, we take off at 140km/hour, and this time, finally, we do arrive at [[L5709]].

1. Meeting people like Abdelhamid, pushing my comfort zone, and seeing what happens.
2. Taking a nice photograph.
3. Working on the blog.
4. Meeting the very occasional English speaker.
5. Seeing progress on the map.
6. Email.
7. A long, hot bath after a day on the road.
8. A warm bed.
9. Talking to Polly and Mia on the satellite phone...even at $1.30/minute.
10. A delicious [[L3083]].
11. Biking, especially moments without a headwind with everything working well.
12. Getting off the bike.  Nice bike, but it feels so good to stop!
13. The occasional feeling of security.
14. Sun!
15. Coffee breaks: thick, dark Tunisian coffee with steamed milk and a lump of sugar.

Things I won't miss:
1. So many vulnerabilities: do I have everything, what does he want, am I safe...?
2. Arab music, at least what I've heard so far...

4. Headwinds.
5. Diarrhea.
6. Car exhaust.
7. Smokers.
8. Sore throats.

I could not convince him that my GPS offered neither music nor video games, and he happily went crazy on all the buttons for 15 minutes to see what he could pull up on the screen.

Mayssar rides a taxi bus the 35 km. to school every weekday in [[L5900]].  He asked if I could give him some money to buy a bicycle.  Instead, I pulled out my map of North Africa, and that was a real eye opener…for me.  Damn, I’ve got a long way to go!  Polly was right.

Making sure dad didn’t notice, Mayssar chewed through half a baguette and all of my cheese.  Then he found my cameras, and demanded to take pictures.  I took a picture of him instead, and promised to send it in the mail.  Dad did not want to be photographed, and wanted me to write the address because (I suspect) he isn’t literate.  Just really, really nice.  I offered some money for the dates, and even insisted, but he would accept nothing.

Polly Dithmer, spouse supreme, Acton, MA: After spending a month in bed in no shape to even walk, Polly gave me a custom bicycle for my birthday.  I could barely stand up for the measurements, but her encouragement got me going, and really got this trip out of the “someday” phase.  

Dr. Ma, acupuncturist, [[L3266]], MA: delicate with the needles, but not shy with some horrifyingly painful maneuvers as well, Dr. Ma finally gave me some relief from the pain that had kept me off my feet for weeks.

Dr. Harrington, chiropractor, [[L3038]], MA: Those neck maneuvers never failed to scare the living daylights out of me, but Dr. H had that magic touch and kept me relatively functional after I got back on my feet. 

MetroWest Physical Therapy, [[L3038]], MA: A therapist from [[L243]] with some great techniques and a magic touch when acupuncture and chiropractia just seemed to be taking too long. 

Fitness Together, Acton, MA: When going to the gym during lunch proved ineffective, I found Jason, Monica, Matt and Brian.  For 8 months, 3 days per week, all I had to do was show up, eat their fruit, and do as I was told: with patience and good humor they made sure I left a physical wreck.  In their hands, I finally made some real progress.

Seriously, I hadn’t ridden a bicycle in ten years or taken a bike trip in fifteen years before this trip, and I hadn’t exercised anything but my drawing and typing muscles since then either.  I know I was a real project, and owe you all a huge thanks.

My trip to [[L5665]] or "the vally of the giants" as its called due to some of the worlds largest trees being in the surounding forests..

Left [[L5883]] on the EasyRider bus, got picked up around 10, Bobby who I met in Dunsbourgh over xmas was on the bus heading to [[L5665]] with me which was cool !

The bus took us into a Winery on the way, I tasted a few wines, and felt a bit ropey right away, think it was to close to breakfast time !!

{{4996|left}}

Another stop of on the way was the [[L2703]] Tree, the world largest climing tree at over 60 meters, the driver told us only 2% of people who intend to climb the tree actually do it...I wasnt letting that stop me, even though about half way up the tree starts to sway as the weather was pretty grim, very windy, had to pass a few people fozen with fear about 3/4 of the way up...anyway worth it when I got to the top, amazing views of the forrest. it used to be used as a fire lookout, so its the tallest one for miles. 
{{4988|left}}{{4987|right}}
{{4986|left}}
our first night in the hostel was pretty messy, we endned up sharing 4 bottles of wine, Im not used to wino hangovers, the next day we both felt like absoloute death  so just watched premiership re-runs on foxtel all day...

Had a tee-total night the evening, couldnt even look at a bottle of wine without feeling sick :-(

the next day, went on an eco cruise, which everyone was raving about, even lonley planet gave said it cant be missed, so we gave it a shot.

The guy running it was a total comedian, it was like a comedy show and eco tour at the same time !
{{4990|left}}{{4989|right}}


Saw the [[L5665]] inlet, which is amzing and untouched by the logging industry.
{{4994|left}}


The boat took us the most stunning beach, (im running out of superaltives here) unreachable by foot, not a sole on it, the waves were some of largest ive seen, and the forrest came down to meet the cliffs !

{{4993|left}}
<br>
{{4992|left}}

After the cruise, spent the afternoon at the beach topping up my amazing tan (yeah right)


The tan or lack of it...what a joke, 8 weeks in [[L12]] and I still look like the milky bar kid !
at least I havnt burnt though..unlike some people, Ive seen a few people who needed hospitalising...grim...
{{4995|left}}{{4991|right}}
anyway, that evening one of the girls in the hostel had a party, for her 19th, so we had a few drinks...quite a few..

tried to stay up for the football, [[L2738]] Vs Arseanl, swapped the wine for the coffee at about 2.30am, waite
Into Algeria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    {{5206|center}}A truck with German plates pulled in the next morning.  One of the border patrol people engaged the driver in a conversation, I wandered over, and there I met Wolf Gaudlitz.  A writer, radio show host, film producer and (not kidding here), traveling picture show, Wolf had visited [[L5]] many times over the last 5 years, and readily took me on.  Wolf had left his Italian wife and 3 year old child in [[L89]] to try and write, and he told me with some resignation that he didn’t know if they would still be there when he got back.  Girls: don’t get any ideas.  He had in his truck a screen and projection equipment, and enjoyed showing movies to the desert people, German movies it turns out, so that no one understood a word but was transfixed nonetheless by the imagery: for most their first experience with film.

Within 3 or 4 hours, we had both been fully processed at the border, Ahmed the guide had arrived, Ahmed had taken official responsibility for my well-being, the bike was loaded in Wolf’s truck, and we were on our way to [[L5902]].  I was in.  My bicycle trip was clearly over for now, but I was in.

Near [[L5955]], friends had arranged a cook-out on a new palm [[L3185]] amid the dunes of the Grand Erg Orientale, and we stopped for several hours to grill meat, and talk and eat.  Wolf’s truck was immediately mired in the sand, and he spent most of the time letting the air out of his tires, moving the truck, and then re-inflating the tires.  I helped where possible, but the joke remained that Wolf was a slave to his machine.  The work literally took him hours.
{{5203|center}}
We continued on to [[L5955]], to the house of Mohammed, a tall, strong-featured friend of Wolf’s from some years back.  Mohammed had rescued Wolf when his rear axle broke outside [[L5955]] during a period of serious banditry and some danger.  Refusing any payment whatsoever, he had seen to the complete replacement of the axle (and from what I could tell, actual milling of axle to fit the truck), completely filled Wolf’s absolutely huge gas tank, and seen to Wolf’s personal needs throughout the ordeal.
{{5204|center}}[[L5955]], waiting to connect with Mohammed

My respect and admiration for these people grow, and my severe embarrassment at some of the shortcomings of our own culture swells equally.  Frankly, they are my own personal shortcomings, not even something vaguely “cultural”.  I try to imagine the reception Mohammed might have were his truck to breakdown in Acton, [[L519]], and while I could imagine extending some
Chez Said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ahmed and I caught the 10pm bus for [[L5904]].  I bought two tickets for 350 Dinar each, and found comfortable, upholstered seats.  In the dark we headed west, a trip I had hoped to bicycle, a trip that would have taken me almost a week accomplished in 4 hours, a trip in utter darkness, stars, the beam of the headlights revealing only sand and the occasional truck carrying three 12 meter long, 90cm diameter steel pipes; on the horizon, occasionally, the glow of some distant settlement.  At every police checkpoint the interior lights went on, the bus approached very slowly, and conversation between the police and the driver was perfunctory.  Otherwise, we drove very, very fast.

In [[L5904]], Ahmed approached a waiting pickup truck, and for 200 Dinar (2 Euro), the bicycle and all my junk was schlepped off to Ahmed’s house where I spent the night on a mattress in his living room.  In the morning, baguette and coffee.  Ahmed answered my list of questions:
1.	Could I move freely without a guide?  Yes, within the M’zab valley.
2.	Could I move outside the valley alone? No.
3.	Could I prolong my visa?  Yes, at the Commissariat de Police, but I need photos.
4.	I have photos.
5.	How do I get to [[L5709]]?  By bus, leaving daily, no guide required.
6.	Where do I stay for a few days while I explore the area?  He had a place in mind.
7.	How to get to this party on Saturday, 120 km from here?  He would arrange it.

I paid Ahmed 6000 Dinar for 2 days of service, plus an extra 1000 Dinar to express my thanks for his help and generosity.  He found another pickup truck, delivered me to a friend with a kind of hotel in the palm [[L3185]] outside [[L5904]], and left me to my own devices.

Chez Said

This is not the trip I had imagined for myself: it is better.  Bad information, bureaucracy, unexpected acquaintances, unimaginable kindnesses, and a bit of pedaling and openness to whatever might transpire have conspired to construct a situation I could never have planned for or imagined.  I will not be bicycling across the Sahara, and I couldn’t care less.
Love and Desire                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I had dinner last night with Mohamed, a 29 year old student of Biology and the Environment with a lot of interest in global warming and nuclear waste.  We talked trash.  He told me recycling was just beginning to become an accepted concept in [[L5]], but that the predominant attitude remained simply to toss everything into the desert.  It pains him, and he speaks of the desert in animate terms, as a thing alive.
{{5285|center}}Hamed might be in love with a Swiss girl who works in the [[L5282]] post office and shares an apartment with a girlfriend, and who may or may not love him.  They have known each other for 15 years, and every year she has come to [[L5904]] and [[L5709]] for vacation to see him.  This year, however, she and her girlfriend decided to go to [[L93]] instead, a turn of events potentially fraught with meaning.

When asked if they had slept together, he said “Yes, but only in [[L212]].  Never here”.  He showed me her picture, a wonderfully normal looking girl in T shirt and jeans with dyed red hair sitting on a hay wagon on a summer day in [[L212]].  She is looking away.  

We are listening to Nina Simone on the stereo, her version of “I’ll Put a Spell on You” reducing us to silence.  ‘Hamed pokes a bit at the fire and says finally, “The girls around here just don’t understand this kind of music”.  He is haunted by the possibility of a life in [[L212]], haunted by his love for the desert and the fact that she will not live here, haunted even by the possibility that his life will always be thus: haunted by “what ifs” and “wouldn’t it be wonderfuls”; haunted, I suppose, by his own desires.

We are joined by a friend of Said, a 47 year old guy in sports management who organized the 6th annual “Marathon des Dunes” here in [[L5904]].  He has been married 22 years and has 4 kids and speaks openly of his very occasional affairs with younger women, showing me proudly on his “portable” the picture of a 29 year old professor in [[L5088]] who isn’t his latest conquest, but who remains in his heart.  His latest girlfriend is 19, he says.

I ask him how this is all arranged, with so many women closed off and protected.  “Ahhh…”, and his eyes alight and he offers a secret smile to communicate his command of the issue. “One simply needs an emissary”. 

 “A man has a wide open heart, and a woman’s heart is closed very tightly: this is nature.  So it is that the man invites into his heart so many people: to fill his heart.  Think into the past, of a time when you loved more than one woman, and you will und

The M’Zabites fled persecution to settle here in the cracks of the desert plain, creating a place so unique and consistent in its architecture that it is now protected by UNESCO.  With [[L5904]] at the center, the villages of Beni Isguem, Bounourra, Malika and El Latouf connect to fill the valley.

Soccer at Malika Haut cemetary

Wandering through Malika Haut late in the day, I was invited in for a cup of coffee by a guy walking home with an armful of baguettes.  He led me into a garden where we sat on blankets and looked at his meticulously organized and labeled photo albums and goofed around with his four kids.  “These albums”, he told me, “will be my cadeaux to my children one day, so that they understand a little of their parents and a little of their past”.
{{5286|center}}
Ben Aoumeur Nadir enjoys disguises, and he shows me an astonishing array of portraits I would never have imagined were the same person. In one street shot, even a blind man with a cane turns out to be Nadir fooling around with his friends.  These were his younger days, however.

Nadir has since become a focused, organized man.  He told me he approaches each day with a precise plan, because without such a plan a man will fall into the void (“La Vide”).  His words were spoken with some emotion, perhaps with the respect of someone who has once survived drowning in the ocean, and still now and then will stare out to sea.

He buys and sells dates, climbs and manages palm trees for others, manages a store now and then, and works on a municipal road construction crew at night.  “This is what I must do to live, to stay strong, to be responsible to my family.  As you can see, however, I still have plenty of time to be with my children”.
{{5291|center}}Nadir’s father kept four wives and produced twenty-nine children (For him, he says, one wife is as much as he can handle).  Perhaps it shouldn’t surprise me so much then to return to Chez Said a few hours later, sit down to a late dinner with Ben Aoumeur Mohammed, and discover I had just had coffee with his half-brother 10 kilometers distant.
At the river                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Denmark 7th-11th Jan 07

On the way from [[L5665]] to Denmark we visited the Valley of the giants Tree Top Walk, which was pretty cool, but not so good with a hangover from last night, 
{{5573|left}}{{5572|right}}
Walked through a walkway suspended above the Karri Tree forest,
{{5571|left}}{{5570|right}}
This was another stop off on the Easy Rider Bus, something I would have missed otherwise !

Next stop the best beach so far…Greens Pool, for a quick swim…and diving off the rocks, then look at Elephant Rocks.
{{5567|left}}{{5565|right}}
A really nice spot, great swimming area, and top rocks to dive off, if your feeling brave
{{5566|left}}{{5564|right}}

After that the bus rolled on into Denmark where I was the only one jumping off, which was fine as I wanted a few days to chill out and rest up again.

Ate fish and chips by the river as I was far too tired to cook !

The next day relaxed by the beautiful Denmark river a minute away from the hostel, and did a little chilled out river walk.
{{5547|left}}{{5546|right}}

Got a call from some friends I met in Dunsbourgh that they were coming over to Denmark for a night, so that evening met them in the pub, Adam Heather, Debs and Jo.

The next day was pretty ropey, dark and gloomy, hammered it down with rain in the morning, we went out in their car to Greens Pool for a swim, and were the only people there as the weather kept changing warm and sunny one minute, cold and grim the next.
{{5545|left}}{{5544|right}}

At one point had to dash back to the car during a torrential downpour, see the three drowned rats in the car
{{5537|left}}{{5563|right}}

Escaped the English style rain with a cup of tea in a random café that seemed to pop out of the bushes when we needed it most, even if  a weird guy was running the place trying to sell us the contents of 5 years worth of car boot sales junk as well as a pot if tea !
{{5539|left}}{{5548|right}}

After that in the howling wind, we walked up the track to Monkey rock ! With some stunning views, well worth it
{{5541|left}}{{5540|right}}

then we found some horses, in a random [[L5252]] !
{{5543|left}}{{5542|right}}

Drove back through to Denmark and with that the gang had to move on to Albany, I could have gone with them but wanted to stay and explore Denmark and to find time to relax for at least 5 minutes..which is proving harder than I’d thought !!

The next day awoke to find Bobby and his girlfriend had arrived and had hired a car and wanted to go out for the day…so no rest for the wicked! O
Deep South !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Albany 12th-14th Jan '07

Struck gold as I checked into my room, met a girl from Scotland who had a car and was about to go out on a mission exploring the area…so I rolled out for the day with her and saw some pretty amazing places, 

The Blow Holes, a Geezer style thing that blew water out of a hole on the cliffs.
{{5557|left}} {{5554|right}}
The Bridge a massive natural beam of rock suspended between two points.
{{5556|left}} {{5555|right}}
The Gap, a huge gorge caved out by the unbelievably powerful waves.

All good…then drove quite a way to Two Peoples national park to find a “Little Beach” probably the most amazing beach ive seen to date.
{{5560|left}}{{5559|right}}
{{5558|left}}

...and then on the way back some sort of feeble thing called Dog rock, see for your self !
{{5561|right}}




Went for a walk yesterday with Bobby & Miko a 15K round trip in preparation for the hike up we have in store in Stirling Ranges national park in a couple of days… walked to the top of Mt [[L1029]] great views of Albany!

Spent an hour trailing the pubs trying to get one to put the [[L2738]] v Watford game on Fox Sports, no one was interested….nightmare, ended up just watching a movie at the hostel!

He hitched 2200 kilometers east to [[L5716]], [[L161]], then 450 kilometers north through [[L5713]] to the border with [[L5]] at I-n-Guezzam.  An agreement between [[L147]] and [[L5]] allowed him to enter [[L5]] legally.  He continued to head north, through [[L5709]], [[L5906]], El-Miniaa, [[L5904]], Laghouat, Tiaret and Oran, arriving at the Morroccan border at [[L2216]] after a 2400 kilometer haul across the Sahara.  In [[L2216]] he payed a Morroccan 2000 [[L5]]n Dinar to smuggle him across the border into Morrocco.  Finally, as he stole into the Spanish enclave of Melilla with 650 Benladeshi refugees, Spanish police nabbed the entire group.  Aliau’s first attempt to reach Europe was over.

The Bengladeshi’s rioted in an effort to escape, and so all were handed over to the Morroccan police, bussed to [[L2212]], Morrocco and put on a plane back to [[L147]].  Now, eight years later, Aliau is back in [[L5904]], [[L5]] working construction and odd jobs and considering his next move.  The work here is diminishing.  He questioned me intently about the [[L233]], wanting to know where it was hot and cold, whether there were many foreigners there like himself, and where there was work.  He wanted to know if I could send him a certificate de herbergement so that he could get a visa.
{{5315|center}}I suggested that he find the [[L147]] community overseas, because one man like myself could not hope to support him indefinitely while he accustomed himself to the USA, but a community might take him on.  I'm not sure I convinced either of us, but I don't think that Aliau will give up: in his eyes and his eagerness, despite all of the obstacles he has endured or perhaps because of them, I saw someone with the dispassionate ability to assess a situation, the imagination to create a possibility, and the energy and animation of someone infused with and inspired by hope.

After a quick tour of the city, we headed to [[L1966]].

After that we went to the Ferrari Museum.

{{158|center}}

We also climbed to the top of the Domo.  We weren't allowed to climb the Leaning Tower.

Then we went to the coast and drove along the hillside of Cinque Terre to Vernazza.

We'd intended to ride the train between cities, but unfortunately, they had a one-day train strike.  So we took a boat instead.
Small towns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We drove to several small towns as we wandered south from [[L5124]] to Rome.  One of the more interesting was [[L5967]], which is a really small town crowded on the top of a hill.
{{169|center}}
One of the streets was so narrow that Rick could reach both buildings out the car windows.

The town cathedral was amazing.

Moving on from Albany on the bus, Bobby, myself and a few randoms headed to Stirling Ranges National Park to climb the infamous Buff Knoll, the highest peak in Western [[L12]], 

It’s quite a drive to the National Park, so we get there early afternoon and head on up the peak, its not such a hot day, which makes the climb pretty good fun.

{{5599|left}}{{5995|right}}

Although 20 minutes later everyone’s roasting as we start to warm up on the steep climb!

Greg our ever-dependable guide is lagging behind, we can see him haling his fat ass up the Montanan so we keep going!

The views are amazing, really enjoying the hike, gives me a taste for potential hikes in [[L172]].
<br>
{{5994|left}}{{5993|right}}

<br>As we start to get to the top the clouds start coming in, and rapidly cools down 
so its on with the fleece, and keep pounding away until we reach the top.

Feels really good to be out hiking again, makers me realise this sort of stuff is why im here.

At the top we chill out (literally) get some food, and catch some more awesome photos of the National Park…and wait for Greg to meet us up at the top!

{{5600|left}}{{5992|right}}

On the way down, its worth taking your time to appreciate the view…don’t think I’ve seen anything like this before of my any of my other hikes from the past!

As we gat back to the bus, we roll a mile or so down the road to a café and have a well earned Jim Beam and Coke! Bliss!

Then we check into the hostel across the road, have a swim to cool down, and then cook and eat…and watch the best sunset yet…over the mountains!!

What a great day! 

Men With Guns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Over dinner with Said I casually mentioned my plan to bike to Guerrera, and he casually mentioned it to the local police, and they casually told him under no circumstances would I be allowed on the roads alone.  No way.  Had he not talked to the police I would have risked the trip by bicycle, but in the face of an explicit “no” I demurred.

I took a taxi.  The 120 kilometers went quickly until 3 kilometers outside Guerrera when we were stopped at a roadblock, and I was summarily hauled into the headquarters of the Guardia Nationale for visa violations.  It is true that my [[L5]]n visa states that it expires on January 14.

I will plead, however, my admittedly suspect case.  On January 12, I went to the Commissariat du Police in [[L5904]] to arrange a visa extension.  The police chief stated that the terms of the visa were such that entry into the country was required before the expiration date, but that the 30 day visa went into effect on the date of entry and could run past the date of expiration.  I did not need an extension.  He was wearing a uniform and sitting in an office responsible for visa extensions, so I believed him…sort of.  I presented this point of view to the Guardia Nationale, however, and they kind of shrugged me off as an absolute idiot.  I couldn’t really blame them.

I have been “detained” in [[L149]], the [[L233]] and now [[L5]], and though each case ended just fine, I can now say with authority that I much prefer [[L5]].  In [[L149]] I was held on a police boat in [[L2209]] harbor for 8 hours for illegally sneaking into [[L2209]] harbor late one night and asking fisherman if they would take me out fishing with them.  The three policemen who questioned me all night finally laughed and called it a day at the end of their shift, and one of them ended up arranging that fishing trip for me and later taking me out on a date…don’t ask.

In the [[L233]] I was once stopped for speeding, and driving with an expired license, registration and inspection.  I had obviously been rather inattentive, in large part due to an impending divorce, yet the $450 fine seemed excessive and the inflexibility of the officers involved made me feel inhuman.  Luckily I could plead extenuating circumstances in court, and got off for $50 and the towing charge of $75.

In the case of the visa violation in [[L5]], nine Men With Guns and Uniforms put me in a chair in the chief’s office and suggested I tell them my story.  I did, and suggested they verify it by calling the [[L5904]] police, which they did without getti

In fact, as long as you work it, it is free.  So it is that the Kherfi brothers started a farm in 1988 and imported Holstein cows from the [[L164]] in 1993, establishing a dairy operation in the middle of the Sahara.
{{5771|center}}[[L5]] imports most of its milk as powder, so the market for fresh milk products is potentially huge, and the government is interested in developing the agricultural sector, so they invested 1.5 million euro in the operation.
{{5776|center}}The surreal and truly jarring experience of traveling 140 kilometers across a hot and uniformly sand colored desert plateau to find a perfectly flat, lusciously moist, and strikingly green grass [[L5252]] is impossible to communicate.  If you narrowed your [[L5252]] of vision as you drove up the dirt road from the highway to the farm you would think you were in Holland.  There are four of these [[L5252]]s, each a perfect circle defined by the length of the irrigation equipment which endlessly travels around at a speed slower than walking.  These [[L5252]]s feed the animals.
{{5775|center}}Kherfi Freres have:
800 hectares
4 irrigated [[L5252]]s
4000 chickens

15 employees
2 large tractors
2 small tractors
{{5774|center}}They produce dates, cereal, vegetables, and milk.  Next year they will begin producing fresh yoghurt and cheese.  The milk I drank copious quantities of was unpasteurized, unhomogenized, staggeringly rich in cream, and absolutely delicious.  I couldn’t get enough of it.  The cows need a little bit of extra care in the summer, insuring that they stay in the shade for example, but otherwise they appear perfectly content.
{{5772|center}}Ibrahim is in his thirties and runs the dairy operation.  He studied in [[L1590]], married a girl he has known since they were kids, and lives in a large house in Guerrera with his parents and his brother’s family.  He showed me a plot of land where he hopes to soon start building his own house, giving he and his wife just a little bit more breathing room.  Living with your parents apparently presents its challenges.

La Source                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       After hours of seriously uncomfortable cross-country travel over a generally trackless waste in a truck with deflated tires, after endless discussions about where we are going and whether we will find it at all since we started too late and the sun has already set, after even a few rants about the lack of preparation by some and their lack of respect for the desert and the ease with which it can seriously ruin your day, we arrive finally at “La Source”.
{{5783|center}}60 years ago the French drilled for oil here, but they found only water: scalding water at 60 degrees Celsius under tremendous pressure.  The water has been flowing into the sand ever since, well known to the shepards and the animals and the citizens of Guerrera, but distant and difficult to access; our campsite for the next few days.
{{5782|center}}The miracle of finding flowing hot water (Life!) out in the middle of nowhere did not diminish the fact that this place is not pretty.  The font itself is concrete and cast iron and rusty steel barrels.  The sand is covered in dried sheep and camel dung.  
{{5785|center}}The remains of campfires lie everywhere, and draped from the scattered thorny bushes blow purple and black and blue plastic grocery bags left to the wind.  Toilet paper is everywhere.  I had found finally a project with which to thank everyone for their endless hospitality and overwhelming generosity.  I was going to clean this place up.
And I did, at least a good portion of it.  The next day, while everyone was off looking for a very expensive radio that had been accidentally left out in the desert as we fumbled our way to our destination, I grabbed some plastic bags and spent 5 hours picking up every piece of plastic or rubber or paper I could find.  I couldn’t bring myself to pick up toilet paper, so I buried that where I found it.  By the time the crew got back without the radio, I had cleaned up 180 degrees of desert surrounding the well.
{{5784|center}}I saw new plastic bags in the bushes as we left 5 days later, so I won’t pretend to have precipitated a dramatic cultural shift.  One night when one of the crew carelessly dumped some trash in the sand, however, I heard some gentle admonishment for his disregard of my efforts.  Most of all I just felt relief that finally, after so many weeks from so many people of endless gifts and favors and acts of kindness, I could reciprocate in a small way to say “thank you”.

Movies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wolf Gaudlitz is the German guy who got me into the country after that cold night at the border, and he is at “La Source” with his traveling picture show.  So it is that one afternoon he mounts his very large movie screen to the side of his truck, hooks up his digital projector and amplifier and speakers, starts his generator, and to an audience of djellaba toting, mutton grilling, mint tea swilling locals (and one would-be bicycle rider), begins showing movies: Turkish movies in French with Arabic subtitles, music videos with no dialogue whatsoever, and at the climax, at the peak of the evening, after we have all been lying on the cold sand on thin blankets for hours and hours and the food is pretty much gone but we are all still huddled around the campfire and wide awake, “March of the Penguins” in German with French subtitles.  I finally called it a night around three in the morning, but the film and the party was by no means over.
{{5786|center}}Wolf, I found out the next day, spent another two hours after the movie finally ended cleaning up the equipment  for fear that the sand would ruin it, so he didn’t sleep at all.
{{5787|center}}When everyone else left a few days later, he suggested I play a part in his latest film.  He has had some success with his movies on the art house scene and even has one of his films at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and I thought, “what the hell”.  For two days I did take after take of walking around, improvising dialogue, saying the most inane things and probably making an absolute idiot of myself.  I walked barefoot over rocks and sheep poop, froze for the early morning shots wearing only a pair of shorts, and cannot imagine how my part fits into the grander scheme.  It’s coming soon to a theater near you.
Stories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Stories I heard late at night by the campfire:

Nasser was bitten by a snake while working at the farm last summer.  He immediately sucked what he could out of the wound, applied a tourniquet to his arm, and was hauled off to Guerrera 30 kilometers away.  There was no anti-venom available.  As he felt the poison working its way up his arm towards his heart he was hauled to a hospital 120 kilometers away in [[L5904]].  There, he spent four days in the hospital in a situation that might best be described as “tenuous”.  He said: “it was important not to panic, because that only speeds your circulation”.  He lived.

A young man from [[L5972]] spent one holiday zipping around the desert on his motor bike without regard for the possible consequences.  It so happened that the electricity went out that night in Guerrera due to some system failure, and so the glow of the town that serves as navigational beacon in the desert was lost.  The young man guessed wrong about his directions, headed straight out into the desert instead of towards town, and ran out of gas without any idea about what had happened.  It was mid-summer and he had no water and within two days he was dead, just a few kilometers it turns out from “La Source” and salvation.

One of the guys working on the farm was also bitten when he dared to have some fun with a snake he found at the farm.  He panicked but had the good fortune to have anti-venom now at the farm, and so also survived.  Death is usually a matter of less than an hour.

Snakes and scorpions are commonplace on the farm, but now, in the winter, they are all hibernating.  In any case, it is only the snakes that are deadly. The scorpion bite is exceedingly painful, sometimes for days, but it will not kill a full-grown man.  I found myself avoiding holes in the sand, covering my boots at night, and kicking rocks before picking them up.

Tourists are usually the protagonists in these death by desert stories, so it was refreshing (?) to hear the more local variations.  In any case, staring around at the monochrome dust and remembering the level of tension as we tried to navigate to “La Source” at night, I’m left with a more than theoretical appreciation for the stakes and the consequences out here in the waste.

It is here in the desert south of Guerrera.

Flies on your lips
Flies in your clothes
Flies on your eyelids
And up your nose

The wax in your ears
The salt in your tears
The sweat on your brow
All fly chow now

Washing their hands
Rubbing their feet
Keeping an eye out
For fresh (white) meat

They swarm, they flurry
Fly clouds in a hurry
Quick to swoop down
On the poop you don’t bury

Cockroaches may be here
Long after man dies
But I’ll put my money
On the survival of flies

Someone call Darwin or Leakey or Goodall: I’m sure it all started here, the origin of the species.
Fire                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wolf and I packed up and got ready to leave before the day advanced much so to avoid traveling at night.  He turned the ignition key, sent power to the starter motor, applied some pressure to the gas pedal and then looked at me with a slight frown.  
{{5793|center}}He asked, “What is that strange noise”?  We listened, and then smelled something burning.  Smoke suddenly billowed black and flames shot out of the underside of the cab.  We bailed, Wolf leaping out with a fire extinguisher, and within seconds the fire was out.  That’s all it took: a few seconds.  The truck was stuck.  We were 50 kilometers from town.
{{5791|center}}On my satellite phone we called for help from Guerrera.  Just before nightfall, Nasser and Ibrahim and three mechanics from town arrived to pull the damaged parts from the truck, and we decided I would accompany them back to town to assist in finding a replacement.  We left after dark, leaving Wolf alone with the truck.  Our vehicle did not have four-wheel drive and so we were not in a position to take off cross-country: we had to find and stay on the main “piste” back to town.  We lost that piste.
{{5790|center}}Remember that drive out to “La Source”?  The indecision, the arguments, the confusion?  Reverse the intended direction, add more Very Opinionated Men, remove every conceivable landmark except the moon and what may or may not be the faint glow of the town (they call that a beacon????), add dirt tracks going in every conceivable direction, and in the back of your mind remember that story of the guy and his motorcycle dying out in the desert after running out of gas: at that point you are ready to imagine the level of concern and….um….discussion in the car when the driver made it clear from his erratic decisions that he hadn’t a clue about where we were or where to go.

All I could remember from my nights out in the tent was that the moon was setting lately in the west and that the town was north.  We had to keep the moon to our left.  That would have been fine but we had to find the piste, and that in the end took us hours.  Even when we found something that looked like it headed in the right direction, we were forced to rely on the moon to keep us oriented; the number of possible tracks to follow and the number of times a track simply disappeared was truly disorienting.  It was with tremendous good fortune that the moon didn’t set until just before we hit the highway, that the tire didn’t go flat until just before town, and that we had a full tank of gas to get us back.  This is

It became obvious that the blowing sand had been only 10 meters or so above the ground all along.  I saw sand dunes the size of mountains as we left the Plateau de Tademait and entered a canyon for Arak.
{{5927|center}}
Arak is a small group of houses made of earthen bricks, a couple of cafes and a gas station.  Long rows of trucks line the roadside, and the café where we stopped for coffee was full of truckdrivers having lunch.  It was pleasant there, with palms giving shade and plenty of white plastic tables and chairs.  There was no tire of the right size available, or it cost three times its usual price, I couldn’t understand the conversation, but we were told the road was good to Tamanrasset and we should just go ahead without the spare.  We filled up the gas tank, negotiated our ninth police barricade since leaving Ghardaia, and moved on.
{{5922|center}}Arak

At 325 km from Tamanrasset, Faysel shredded the back left tire.  I felt complicit in our situation, aghast at the stupidity of not insisting on getting a spare at Arak.  We pulled over behind a parked truck, a bus came by, and Faysal hopped aboard with one wheel to get a tire at In Ecker, 160 km away.  I sat down with the truck drivers on a blanket they had put down under a tree, and we shared tea and peanuts.  

Beudjabbara Slimone owns his own truck and drives all over Algeria depending on his latest load.  He lives in Ouargla, where his kids all go to the university.  We discussed the usual: politics, family, kids, and whether life was better in the US or Algeria.  I argued for life among family and friends and a culture you knew no matter where that might be.  He told me there were no tires at In Ecker, that Faysal would have to go all the way to Tamanrasset, and that he would be back tomorrow at the earliest.  He suggested I move the car off the road in case of bandits or thieves.

We were joined by three other truck drivers, one young guy pulling out a collection of three year old postcards written in English from a Hungarian girl he had met over the internet.  He had held them all this time and never gotten them translated and simply wanted me to tell him the romantic bits, but there were none except for a single use of the word “Dear”.  In any case, they were three years old.

I took their picture, got their addresses, and they took off for Tamanrasset.  I sat in the car and tried to read Faysal’s French literature and waited

A quick trip to this place called “Wave Rock” in my opinion a massive pointless detour, but it’s on the lientery, so we stuck to it, 

Basically a huge rock shaped like a wave formed over thousands of years over water running over the edge and running down. Not sure where this running water is, this place is dryer than your mouth on a Sunday morning after a massive night out.

There was a dam, which held a massive amount of water for the local inland, totally arid area! Aparantly back in the day little kids used to swim in it, now its all fenced off and secure! Water seems more valuable the gold around here.

Anyway quick photo op, and a quick shufty around and were back on the bus headed for Esperance…

Arrived in Esperance and we immediately went to Twilight cove, a popular beach in the town area, but was deserted at 4pm when we arrived, maybe thats because of the alleged sharks..

Swam straight out to the huge rock a couple of hundred meters off shore, climbed up and jumped off a few times, slowly at first, but the three of us we were doing triple jumps from the top, really good fun especially id you land in a wave as it passes by…

Managed to get a action shot, see the 3 figures caught in mid flight, see above.

Spent the evening eating the biggest portion of fish and chips, with a few beers & playing pool.

Next morning at 7am we shot out to Cape Le Grande National park about 30km out of town, climbed Frenchman’s peak, a steep climb, but not as tough or as long as the hike the other day up Bluff Knoll…but not before I set fire to my socks first thing trying to dry them out in the microwave...DOH

{{6010|left}}{{6009|right}}

After that we hit Lucky bay for a look at this sunning beach, but choose to spent our time at Hellfire beach had lunch, and Greg taught a few of how to body surf…the next best thing when you don’t have a body board!

After that the Easy Rider Bus rolled on, but as I was staying in Esperance I had 5 days to my self until the next bus…

{{6012|left}}{{6014|right}}

During which I did the great ocean drive, but on a mountain bike with a Helen a French Canadian girl from the Hostel, brilliant cycle track right along the coast, 20k return, went all the way back to twilight cove for a swim…and a dive.

{{6017|left}}{{6016|right}}

Did a cruise to Woody Island one of over a hundred islands that form the Recherche Archipelago, basically these islands helped two French ships shelter from a storm back in the day, and then allowed them to discover Esperance! Saw sea eagles and sea lions and heaps of other stuff on this cruise and did a short walk on Woody island.

Went running in the evenings along the coast, chilled out, watch [[L2738]] Beat Chelsea 2-0…basically had a great time !

Spent almost all day driving from Esperance to Kalgoorie, get there around 6pm, and went out and had some dinner and a few beers in the pub! It’s a bit of a rough and ready place full of miners that look like they could wrestle a bear, and full of girls that look like they do anything for money.

Money talks in Kal, the gold mine is the biggest open cut goldmine in the southern hemisphere, and makes almost $5 billion dollars year so the workers who work in this red hot inland desert heat trap are paid very well.
{{6020|left}}{{6021|right}}
We had a look at the Super pit at night and during the morning, as it runs 24/7 churning out gold non stop…

Looks miles wide, impossible to photograph in one shot !!
All the equipment is massive, bigger than anything ive seen before…

All the pubs in Kal have topless barmaids, and later in the evening are simmering bar room brawls waiting to happen, and look like something out of the Wild West!
{{6023|left}}{{6024|right}}
It was great fun, as there was a few of us, and we had some drinks then went back to the hostel to have a few more, before bed, then off early doors as it’s a full day drive back to Perth, but pretty hellish when the air-con conked out mid morning!
La Reve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I dreamt last night that I was staying in a reed hut in the middle of the desert, and that I lay under a brightly lit almost-full moon sky with shadows sharp against the sand.  Around me, mountainous piles of oddly shaped [[L3136]]s stood in silhouette and I could not sleep but instead lay for hours tracking the moon across the sky. A cold wind arose and I slept finally to dream of a complicated mathematic I was supposed to understand but could not.  

I awoke to find the moon set, a man making tea over an open fire, and a woman shaking her right hand with thumb and forefinger fixed in rigid “L”, a herd of goats clattering behind her.  9,000 year old petroglyphs in red ochre lay here amid green artemesia and thornier plants, and I walked later across a sandy plain tattooed by scarab and moula moula tracks to find them.  Under an overhanging [[L3136]], staring up at an animal of incomparable elegance painted 320 generations ago, I suddenly experienced an overwhelming feeling of deep, inner tranquility.  

It came as some surprise to recognize that this was exactly what I had come for.

Screaming kids and Finding Nemo on the TV!

Anyway get in to [[L5319]] and go straight into town, I didn’t want to fall asleep like I did in [[L98]] and mess up my sleep pattern for a week.

Spent the day I a walking around …really tired, bought some hiking boots for the trip and basically just wandered about in a daze…no change there then!
{{6342|left}}{{6343|right}}
The next day went out for a walk with Will a guy from the hostel I met the night before, did part of the coast to coast walk from Mt Eden to One Tree Hill then caught the bus back! Got great views from the top of these ancient Mauri sites and inactive volcano’s, weird to see them in the middle of a suburban area! But a pretty good day out!

Did a free bus tour laid on for the backpackers, got to climb the [[L6112]] bridge for free which was ace, got some amazing views of the city, then it took us over the water to a part of [[L5319]] called [[L3231]]…had fish and chips…all good!

Went to go out for a beer with a guy from the tour but he reckoned he was too tired! What a feeble effort! So just wandered about on my own got some good night shots, then went back to the hostel with a couple of cans!

Met up with James from My [[L5654]] days earlier on my trip, went up the Sky tower got some more pictures, and chilled out got some great Vietnamese food in the market
{{6360|left}}{{6361|right}}
[[L5319]] seems to rely on the Sky Tower for its source of identity; and without it its Skyline would be unrecognisable from a 1000 other cities.

Its really expensive to do anything in the city, alienating its self from the backpackers even though it’s the gateway to many of the tours the backpackers will embark on!

Food, drink and activates are unbelievably highly priced, bottled water more expensive than petrol, and food…pasta that cost 69c in Oz is $4 over here…I’m glad my trip has food included!

[[L5319]] is nice, but that’s all it is, plus it lacks the cutting edge other major places either the style of London, the romance of [[L1590]], or the magic of New York, I was left slightly disappointed with my first taste of [[L172]]…close but no cigar!

I met Ben Sebgag Lakhdar over a year ago the modern way: trolling the internet.   Lakhdar posted his picture and some photographs of Tamanrasset and the surrounding desert on a website called Virtualtourist.com, designed to showcase the travels of its members.  I sent him an email from Acton discussing my plans to travel through the Sahara, and we embarked on a bit of correspondence which culminated in Lakhdar preparing and sending me a “Certificat de Herbergement”, a notorized piece of paper stating that he would give me a place to stay during my visit to Tamanrasset, between October 2006 and January 2007.  This statement is meaningless because in fact, I am staying at “Encampment Dromadaire”, not with Lakhdar, but the document is required to get a tourist visa to Algeria.
{{6104|center}}On the site of a 100 year old Governor's palace, currently being reconstructed.

Lakhdar is an architect, a lucky coincidence that immediately gave us plenty to discuss.  He studied at a university in the north of the country for six years, received his degree, came back to Tamanrasset, and within a couple of years found his present job.

Lakhdar works for the state, in exactly the same capacity as an architect working, for example, for the State of Massachusetts.  He administers contracts, oversees the selection of architects and the development of the design and construction documents, and keeps an eye on contractor selection and actual construction.  He told me that he appreciated his job, but that it kept him at a distance from the actual architecture and prevented it from being an affair of the heart.  He hopes to open an office in the next five or six years for exactly this reason.
{{6098|center}}
Thursday here is Saturday in the States: the start of the weekend. I left him an email yesterday suggesting we get together, and he came by to pick me up this morning at “Dromadaire”.  We went to a café for a cup of tea and then walked through the city discussing everything from city planning to meeting girls.  
{{6101|center}}
A marriage, he told me, costs 7 camels and possibly some clothes and jewelry.  Lakhdar has 2 camels kept by his dad, who apparently wanders the desert “en trek” with a herd of camels.  (He doesn’t take tourists, he doesn’t deliver salt, and there isn’t a route.  He just…wanders…).  Lakhdar stated the he found the girls here especially materialistic and this made it difficult to begin a relationship.  Instead of discovering each others ideals and values from the s

I had loftier ambitions and more substantial concerns this time around.

1.	Laptop:  Yes, this blog is possible in part because I bought the very tiny, very expensive, and truly wonderful Sony Vaio VGN-TXN15P from Circuit City in Natick, Massachusetts.  It weighs just over 2 pounds, measures something like 8” x 10” x 1”, and easily fits into my bike bags.  It has a single Intel Centrino processor so it is not the fastest machine on the street, but it comfortably handles the applications I use (Explorer, Word, and my camera software primarily) and it is loaded with connectivity options that make internet access in all kinds of situations a real breeze.  I have walked into hotels in Tunisia and picked up the internet wirelessly, and I have reconfigured plug-in connections with a minimum of dumb fumbling in many internet cafes since.  I generally plug my own computer into internet café wires to simplify transfer to the blog of my photos and essays, which I typically prepare ahead of time.  I back-up all my stuff on SD cards but SD slots have not been available.  I get 3-4 hours out of the battery, which isn’t exactly awesome but has proved sufficient so far.  I originally considered a smaller and much more durable unit with 11 hours of battery life made for the US military, but it didn’t support SD cards and it didn’t have a CD drive, both of which I considered vital.  I wanted the machine to be useful after as well as during the trip (assuming it survives!).  The machine resides in a padded carrying case Polly and I found at The Container Store in Natick, Massachusetts.
2.	Solar Collector:  An important criterion for all of my electronic devices was that they run on AA batteries: easy to carry, easy to replace, easy to find everywhere.  Some devices like the laptop were only available with proprietary batteries however, and for them I purchased a solar collector over the internet from Real Goods/Gaiam in Colorado.  It rolls up into a 4” diameter, 15” long tube and delivers a charge...slowly.  I haven’t used the collector yet because the trip has evolved into something much less remote than what I had originally conceived, but may yet do so in Niger.
3.	Camera 1:  I originally thought this trip would make a great video, and found a tiny Samsung video camera with additional remote I could bolt onto my bike helmet.  It also takes stills and plays music I have stored on an SD card.  I discovered, however, that finding video content of a
Kids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I told Lakhdar that I had a very demanding audience (!) that wanted to see what life was like for kids here in [[L5]], and he promptly brought me to an elementary school in one of the newer neighborhoods near his house.  We entered the school walls through a big, blue sheet metal gate and found ourselves in a big dirt courtyard.  To the left was a small building obviously housing toilets, straight ahead was a long building fronted by an arcade that housed the classrooms, and to the right was a small building housing the offices, with additional buildings I couldn’t identify beyond.  Everything was surrounded by the wall, but I noticed later that the classrooms had windows out the back protected by metal grates.  Groups of kids were hanging out in the arcade, laughing and chatting.
{{6148|center}}
We entered the principal’s office, and shook hands with a black man wearing a white turban, a reddish robe and glasses.  I thought he introduced himself as a friend of M. Fitzgerald (that couldn't be right!), but he did not speak Dutch (oy vey!), English, Spanish or French, and so Lakhdar translated between French and Arabic.  I stated that I had come from the [[L233]], that I had an eleven year old daughter who was interested in knowing more about how kids live in [[L5]], and that I would appreciate permission to visit a classroom and perhaps take some pictures.  It came as no surprise to me at all that this would require permission from the highest levels, and that it would be impossible to do so today.  Lakhdar and I agreed upon leaving that this meant it wouldn’t happen ever, so he took me to meet a friend of his who taught school but was playing hookie…I mean was out sick…to get the story.
{{6147|center}}
We meandered on foot, stopping at Lakhdar’s office (not much work until [[L5088]] approves this year’s budget), walking through a project, chatting with friends he met along the way, meeting Tayeb Benzouada finally out on the street near the center of town.  He invited us into his home, and as always we removed our shoes before stepping onto a big rug in a concrete room with an open door and no windows.  We adjusted ourselves on the mattresses and pillows lining the edges of the room, a metal cup with water arrived, then an omelet and bread and tea.  We sat around the omelet and took pieces using bread as a fork.  A very old man in a blue robe and white turban shuffled in with a cane and lay down.  He seemed to mutter a bit to himself, and we chatted about school.

I immediately diagnose cancer due to radiation exposure at In Ecker or from the hours spent on the satellite phone, and go back to sleep.  The next day I decide to see if it goes away by itself, but do call Polly to ask Dr. L for some strategies in dealing with this little problem.  I notice a sore throat and some sniffles, but it all seems quite mild.
{{6097|center}}Encampment Dromadaire

It is time to start taking my malaria pills in anticipation of [[L161]] and I pop one of them after breakfast.  The [[L3083]] prescription bottle from CVS says take one per week with food and plenty of water.  Later that day I have lunch with friends and by the time I get back to Dromadaire I know something is terribly wrong: I feel a little dizzy, a little flush, a little achy.  The sore throat and sniffles add a little je-ne-sais-quoi.  I eat very little at dinner, and get into bed.  Chills and a fever arrive to keep me company.  My stomach is already dancing when Violent Diarrhea prances in, ready to party.  I’m not in the mood, but Diarrhea insists and we stay up all night together, shaking and carousing to Bob Marley on the MP3 player: 

“I’m hurting, I’m hurting deep inside, 
good God now hear my cry, hear my cry, 
my my my my cry,

{{6050|center}}Encampment Dromadaire

The African toilet consists of a porcelain tray set into the floor with two raised footsteps and a single hole.  Dromadaire is kept meticulously clean but that open hole always smells a bit.  A squatting position is required, which I personally find very uncomfortable but which seems to come naturally to everyone else.  A tap and a bucket serve as toilet paper and flush mechanism, and a sink outside allows you to wash your hands afterwards.
{{6175|center}}As a paperless system I suppose it has certain ecological assets, but I find the whole thing a pain in the a--.  I walk back and forth between the toilets and my room all night and by morning I am empty and exhausted.

I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.  The late morning sun insinuates itself through the joints between the wood slats of the shutter of my single window, casting shadows on the wall in front of me. 
Transience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      When I was very young and living in Holland I had a little song I hummed to myself every night as I went to sleep.  It consoled me lying there alone, especially when bats flew at the windows, and humming it was an important and meaningful ritual.  It puzzled and frustrated me greatly then, when one evening I could not remember the tune.  How was it possible to lose something so important after so long, when I hummed it every night?  How could my own mind work against me like this?  How was it capable of such [[L3309]]?  Even more surprising, the tune returned some weeks or months later, long enough that I almost didn’t recognize it when it came to me.  It was a short-lived [[L187]], and I could feel the tune slipping away from me again over several nights until it finally disappeared for good.  I remember actually wishing it farewell, and coming to some acceptance of its final disappearance, and I have not forgotten in over 40 years that I once had this song and that it went away…

I mention it as a reminder to myself I suppose, of the inevitability and importance of change.  I have been thinking about [[L5709]] since I was 20 years old, and even though the [[L5709]] I am visiting now is something entirely different from that [[L5709]] of 28 years ago, coming here has certainly felt like the fulfillment of something important.  It is time, however, to leave.  

To Faysel Abdelassiz and to Ben Sebgag Lakhdar, both of whom made my stay here so meaningful: my deepest thanks and very best wishes.  I cannot currently imagine the circumstances that might allow us to see each other again, but I certainly hope that we may.  “It’s a small world”, I hear, but it doesn’t feel that way to me.  To both Faysel and Lakhdar I can only say: “You are my friend, and my door stands open for you”.  [[L161]] beckons.  [[L28]] beckons.  I hope both countries will forgive my current sentiment, which is that this was the climax and the rest is dénouement; I may feel otherwise later.  I leave here, in any case, with heavy, heavy heart.
Sick, Part Deux                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This lump on my neck has gotten bigger and redder and more painful, and my level of concern is, um…enhanced.  It is now bigger than my Adam’s Apple.  Polly calls International SOS, my travel insurance company, and they refer us to their Paris office for a referral here in Tamanrasset.  The Paris office is wonderful, I am spared the difficulty of explaining my needs in French, and they tell me to call back in an hour while they figure out whom to send me to.
{{6174|center}}
With a whole hour to think about it, my imagination is given free rein.  Bad.  Very, very, very bad.  As Polly will attest, I’m already verging on hypochondria.  Everything that happens to me is the worst thing that ever happened, IN THE WORLD!

Image 1: Alien, where those creatures grow inside living human beings until they are mature enough to explode out of their cocoon’s stomach.  Only, this would be my neck.

Now, that sounds very melodramatic, but Laurie Newman Osher will attest to a little episode in Peru in which a Bott Fly laid eggs in the pores of her skin, resulting in these large, white worms growing sub-cutaneously to her significant discomfort.  They were finally coaxed out by a gentleman who came to our house, smoked possibly two packs of cigarettes in a row, collected all that nicotine from his breathe in a handkerchief and applied it to Laurie’s skin.  Denied oxygen, these monstrous worms made their way to the surface, where they were speared and extracted.  Yikes.

Image 2: Cancer, the voracious, terminal-within-weeks kind that snatches its helpless victims with barely time to say good-bye.  All this radiation: In Ecker, the sun, the satellite phone…the poetry of it is irresistible: hapless victim realizes life-long dream to cross Sahara Desert only to die in the arms of…well, who know?  Hollywood would find some beautiful Tuareg who had hoped I would be her ticket to a better life, I’m sure.  Wolf Gaudlitz would probably have some thoughts…

OK, cancer just seems a little too awful to consider, and perhaps rather unlikely: this thing has become a raging nightmare in only 4-5 days.

Image 3: Environmental Factors.  The glands in my neck are stressed beyond endurance due to all the banned insecticides and herbicides American companies dumped on the African market.  Every meal I eat further throws me into the chemical soup, until finally my thyroids swell up like balloons.  It isn’t the old lump on my neck but the glands behind it that are the issue…

This one doesn’t sound too bad.  I leave Tamanrasset, my kidneys a
Bay of islands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  First day out of [[L5319]] set off on the Flying Kiwi bus...We set of to the Bay of Islands in the north region know as North Land !

as we get on the bus I see to be the only bloke, the driver laughs and says "its you and the ladies this trip mate" Immediately I think cool ! but actually no that might be pretty annoying ! turns out we picked up two other guys round the corner who have girls names ! and confused the staff ! so it turns out to be 3 guys and about 10 girls ! that's more like it...some one to play beach football with !!
{{6588|left}}{{6585|right}}
Head up into [[L5491]], and first bit of riding kicks in, dropped off a few Km from the campsite, three of us ride in to the campsite via a waterfall, round it not through it !

Just 8k today, to ease into it !!

Get to the campsite...pitch up...cook up some food ! and have a beer or two !
{{6583|left}}{{6586|right}}
The next day most of the gang had opted for a sailing trip, costing $125 I gave that a miss and took my bike out and did a massive ride, from our site down to the coast, took ht ebike on a ferry over to russell, rode down through the island, back on another ferry and back up to camp, about a 30k round trip...but very hilly, non stop up and down hills ! a lot of hard work ! but worth it for the downhill runs!
{{6578|left}}{{6579|right}}

Start to really see some of NZ's great scenery from the ride, shame it was a bit over cast, wont make for the greatest of pictures, very green and great looking down atythe water from up the top of the hills !
{{6580|left}}{{6581|right}}

Its a great start, really enjoying the trip !! great people too !
Sandboarding !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The next day we set off to [[L6019]], and get there early about 10am, we shoot over the water on a speed boat, and go sand boarding which was awesome ! so cool to be bombing down the huge dunes on a body board and then flying into the water !

Quite a hike to the top but worth it for the ride down...this is becoming a trend in this place!!
{{6610|left}}{{6609|right}}

Saw Tane Mahuta the largest tree in NZ...pretty cool forest, so green ! full of Kauri trees the same type as in [[L5665]] in Oz.

{{6589|left}}{{6590|right}}
Camped at the beach in the afternoon, and went to a Thermal Pool water park, with some cool slides ! and a Hot tub with a movie screen !! stayed there all night swimming and messing about.

Us boys couldnt get enough of the Black hole water slide, and kept going back for more action ! shame I couldnt get any pictures of the place..

Awesome view the following morning over the sea 

{{6591|left}}{{6587|right}}

Hot Water Beach !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Drove back down into [[L5319]] momentarily, to pick up some new people, 2 guys & 3 girls...

I was dropped off with some others and we rode a grand total of about 30Ks to camp, not before taking a couple of stop offs at Hot water beach and cathedral cove, before eventually free wheeling 2K down a hill almost directly into our campsite...again right by the beach ! 

The ride was excellent, great weather, blue skies and 25C warm sunshine !! started off on a hard uphill, but got some awesome views of what was to come further along the trip.
{{6602|left}}{{6593|right}}
Hotwater beach was a great way to cool off, and I was right into the sea for a swim, and then flaked out for 20 mins before setting off again on the ride, 
{{6594|left}}{{6596|right}}
Cathedral cove...our last stop was amazing, probably the most stunning scenery I've seen on my trip so far, Its just a shame the pictures don't seem to do it justice, I just had to stand and soak it up for about an hour, as did the others I was with, Paddy and Chris!

{{6613|left}}{{6612|right}}
{{6611|left}}
A great night at the camp, a curry and we sat around with some music on wityh a few beers looking up at the stars, and had a great time, although one too many tequilas made me feel pretty ropey when I woke up!

Rotorua                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         {{6599|left}}{{6605|left}}
Drive down to an cool beach, forget its name ! I'll look it up...
{{6607|left}}{{6603|right}}
Half way through the journey my hang over kicks in, last nights tequila kicks in and I feel shocking, feel like staying on the bus, but a bottle of powerade sorts me out and Im playing beach Football with Annis in minutes, he's an Morrocan ex professional footballer, so he's damn good! its ages since I kicked a ball, so glad we have one now !

Swam in the sea, best beach for swimming so far in NZ, went for a run with Aniss, Paddy, and Chris, did a mile down to the caves and back !

Had lunch then shot off to [[L5655]], which stinks...no not like Grimsby...but because its a thermal area that has an volcano in the town, don't think its active, not sure my tent would withstand boiling lava !!

{{6601|left}}{{6600|right}}
Everyone was lapping up the beach!
{{6606|left}}

About to shoot off and ride the remaining distance about 20k to the campsite...tonight its a bush camp so no facilities at all !!
bye for now
Dive Dive Dive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Today another busy day on the FK express...we were up early and off to see the Geothermal features at the [[L5494]] volcanic zone, saw a bubbling mud pit, a geezer erupt 30 ft into the air...and all sorts...it stunk though...a bit like Rory’s room in the flat!
{{6697|left}}{{6698|right}}
Later on we shot over to the River Rapids, saw the Hukafalls the water flowing through is around 220,000 litres per second. Its grade 6, so its incredibly dangerous, apparently some crazy white water kayakers tried to paddle it, and died in the process!
{{6699|left}}{{6701|right}}
a few of us walked down the river to meet the bus, and shot over to the airfield for the SkyDiving!!
{{6703|left}}{{6705|right}}
Which in short was the best thing ive ever done, everyone was bricking it as we were waiting, apart from me obviously, that is until they open the door at 12,000ft up thats over 4 km in the air!
{{6707|left}}{{6711|right}}
The view over the lake and the feeling was phenomenal, I can’t put it into words, so I wont even try!
{{6708|left}}{{6709|right}}
The free fall from 12000ft to 5000 lasts 45 seconds then the canopy opens and your slow right down and cruise to the ground, my instructor was chatting to me the whole way down, I thought my eyes were going to pop out as my goggles began to slip off!!  
{{6710|left}}{{6706|right}}
That night we spent the night in cabins as we were up at the crack of dawn to head of on a epic hike...the Tongariro Crossing...one of National Geographics “top 10 one day walks” in the world! 
Sahara Landscapes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Camping between [[L5709]] and I-n-Guezzam.

Border                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The crossing from [[L5709]] took 2 days.  Tire pressure was the chief concern, avoiding “fesch-fesch” (particularly fine and voracious sand)a priority, and keeping dust out of the truck an impossibility.  We ate a lot of sand.  
{{6618|center}}I've been away too long...

Late in the first day we encountered a truck mired in sand, a crew of Tuaregs working to clear the tires.  Wolf stopped the truck, grabbed his camera and started filming from a distance, but we were quickly discovered.  Wolf later said what scared him the most was their eyes: there was no there there.  
{{6619|center}}Refer to Steven Spielberg's first movie after film school

The crew came after us with rocks, there was a brief intervention from Ahmed as Wolf, shirtless, stared them down, and we quickly retreated to the truck with the gear.  Ahead of them now, we soon realized they had gotten underway, and we spent a tense hour attempting to put some distance between us before finding a campsite well away from the piste.  There was no question in our minds that the crew we had encountered with that truck would attack if they ran into us again.  We kept our lights off until it seemed impossible that they hadn’t passed on, kept an eye out when later that evening a truck stopped on the piste near us, and finally slept without incident.
{{6663|center}}Paving crew taking a break

We reached Laouni the following day.  The treacherous Laouni sand flats have ended the trip for hundreds and hundreds of travelers forced to simply abandon their cars to the desert as their engines consumed sand or the sand consumed their tires.  Many have died losing the correct piste and driving off into the desert until their gas runs out.  I had seen grim pictures and read grim stories and so did not expect to find many of the wrecks removed and a paving crew extending asphalt this far north.  Laouni as a significant threat to north-south traffic appears to be no more.
{{6665|center}}We needed diesel at In Guezzam late the second day, and discovered when we finally arrived a tremendous line of cars waiting for gas delivery.  
{{6664|center}}Luckily they weren’t waiting for diesel.  Unfortunately, we parked in front of a police barracks, accidently included the building in some pictures, and were immediately stopped by two hefty characters who demanded our cameras.  
{{6625|center}}Again Ahmed intervened and after some tense negotiation managed to save our gear, but we were too late to cross the border into [[L161]].  I suppose it was poetic symmetry then, that I
Aboubacar Mahamadou                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I met Aboubacar at the mosque within 10 minutes of entering [[L5716]] (Monsieur, donne moi une cadeau!), and he was quick to show me his bicycle: no brakes, lots of maintenance required.  I told him I would help him with some adjustments before I left town.  

Two days later his friends nabbed me on the street to tell me Aboubacar was looking for me, and later that evening he met me at the internet cafe for the promised tune-up.  I removed the two functional brake pads, installed them on the rear brake, adjusted as required, and until these pads wear down to the nubs, at least, he can safely stop his bike.
{{6681|center}}Now he meets me at the internet cafe and watches patiently while I type, happy to look at my photographs and possibly quite proud to be an internationally recognized star of the blogosphere.
Life gets serious! (Well, a little anyway)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We moved hostel from Kings Cross to Central [[L1031]] in order to be closer to the action and nearer our new home, you may as well familiarise yourself with an area before you move in!  With a home address arranged the means to pay for this home became our prevailing concern.  First stop, the Internet.  We had minimal success with actuall jobs but we managed to register with a million agencies.  Of those million agencies at least 5 phoned back and requested an interview/test/waste of our time.  Shortly after registering with a company and the night before we were due to move into our new house I (Tim) was called and asked if I could start work the next day, I said "yes and no, as I've got to move house" their response was that they would call back.  Friday 13th October and I received a call from the agency saying I should get into work for a few hours that day for a handover, a traditionally spooky day made spookier still with the stress of moving house and starting.....WORK!   

So as we got settled in our new home in a lovely part of town - Ultimo near Darling Harbour - and got quainted with our housemates. I quickly got into the routine of work, but Priya still had to find something....however a few days here and there took her around [[L1031]] and into the city centre. So here goes nothing...."Hi Ho Hi Ho, Its off to work I go...."
Mt Doom                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Tongariro Crossing is an 8 hr Hike taking you across and past Mt Ngauruhoe, Mt Ruapehu and Mt Tongariro known to the Lord of the Rings fans as Mt Doom and Mordoor, spectacular scenery! A real climb. 
{{6719|left}}{{6716|right}}
{{6717|left}}{{6737|left}}
Was with the girls at the start, but they were far too slow, so I caught up to the lads and did most of the walk with Aniss and Paddy
{{6723|left}}{{6724|right}}
Finished the trip in less than 6 hours! 
{{6720|left}}{{6718|right}}
The weather changes dramatically, nice & warm by mid morning, but by the time your at the top its Freezing!
{{6721|left}}{{6722|right}}
Totally excellent day, and we had a great time doing the hike, or Tramp as they call it over here! 
Got some great photos too !

Getting Settled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 So as we got settled in our new home and got quainted with our housemates. Tim quickly got into the routine of work, I still had to find some....but a few days here and there took me around [[L1031]] and into the city centre. Then, I got an assignment to work in Bondi! Awesome is all I have to say, I was basically doing HR for a Silver Service Catering Company that were based on the beach front! It was pretty cool walking down Bondi at 7.30 in the morning and seeing the surfers and the beach totally empty and then watch it pick up as i gazed from my office seat and then join the madness on the beach and have my lunch! Absolutley great fun but a bit of a nightmare to commute to. Getting back at 8pm and then waking up to start the day again at 5.30am wasnt my cup of tea as I couldnt enjoy the evenings or weekends properly - And anyway whats a Working Holiday Visa when you take out 'Holiday'???? I havent got the intention to be sponsored or move on a long term basis - so it was back to city center based assigments and lots more time for Tim and I to spend together! Definately worth the change!  And to save some bucks knowing that you also get your tax back and having fun is what its all about!  Cant wait to spend it all now! 
Diwali!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         {{4109|right}}The Indian Festival of Lights and New Year! Diwali is a very special day in the Indian Calender and I was about to spend it for the first away from the UK and my family and friends. But a big thank you goes out to my family who sent me a card and made me feel right at home. And also to Nitya and Vidya, our housemates with whom I celebrated Diwali with. Tim and I and the girls went to St Helensburg about 90mins away from [[L1031]] where we visited a South Indian Temple in the mountains. It was so cold in there as it is made entirely of Marble, and is very well ventilated, ie no carpets or windows or doors! But it was absolutely beautiful and that made it worth it. Here we made some offerings and said some prayers and basically had a really fun  day out! We even got some Roti and Curry for lunch which Tim especially enjoyed! 

Back at home, I had prepared some sweets in the morning and made some vegetable curry for the evening; so we tucked into that after lighting some candles and diya's (little lamps) aorund the house and saying some more prayers. Yummy!
The Motor Show                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  {{4111|center}}The International Motor Show was in town at the [[L1031]] Convention Center, so we were hoping to see some fantastic cars and bikes! While we werent disappointed overall, especially considering a healthy Ferrari, Maserati and Ssanyong presence this was no [[L5128]] or London Motor Show. Saying this, it gave us a welcome break from the usual mid week routine of cook, clean, sleep. And we did get to see just what exactly Holden does has to offer....Not Much!!!!

Trish's Birthday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                A big Happy Birthday to our fellow traveller and friend Trish whom we have spent many months travelling with around South East Asia and here in [[L12]]. We went out for one of the best dinners ever - Fact! - at the lovely and very posh restuarant 'Coast' on Darling Harbour, where thanks to Trish and her colleagues we sampled the best [[L12]]n Cusine has to offer! 
Christmas 2006!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 {{5068|left}}Wow, its Christmas already! The Time has literally flown by and here we are in [[L1031]] ready to celebrate Christmas. The only weird thing that you just have to experience if you are out in [[L1031]] at this time of the year is obviously having Christmas in the Summer! Barbeques, Seafood, Salads and Summer Fruits. So strange! Especially more so, when you see everyone Christmas shopping around you and window displays have Santa Sleighs or Elves in snow and little kids wrapped head to toe in wolly hats and scarves and jumpers and coats yet you're walking around in nothing but your tshirt, shorts and flip flops! 

{{5067|right}}Of course there are the usual haunts for all the tourists to go to at Christmas in [[L1031]] but we didnt fancy a crowded beach where you cant have a beer with your barbeque. So we made it special in our own little way and made good use of our huge balcony and had a pinic - all courtesy of the brilliant chef and wonderful friend, Trish! It was wonderful, sitting outside and having a couple of glasses of wine and chilling out for the afternoon. The sun stayed out and we had a great day....and we couldnt help but smile as we thought of good old England and the rain!  
Finding Nemo.....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Whilst we were on holiday from work it would be rude not to go out and see some of the attractions [[L1031]] has to offer! So off to the Aquarium it was, and having Tims work pass made it a bargain entry! [[L1031]] Aquarium boasts the most water based lifeforms outside of the barrier reef, and has a large underwater tunnel and walkway which was definately pretty cool! 

{{5086|right}}Our first encounter was the DuckBilled Platypus which was a very nifty thing that had its route planned in its tank and just kept on doing its loops - almost as barmy as the otters in Singapore! But very very cool! The Platypus is a very strange looking creature close and you dont actually realise but it has seethrough proctective eyelids for when its swimming underwater and has venomous claws that can actually kill! Sweet! Moving on, we saw an infinite number of fish and eels, and sharks and fish and eels and more fish....all beautiful, strange and some just downright scary. Then on to the scariest of them all....our first encounter with an australian crocodile. This one was a freshwater one, and absolutley huge. But not the biggest that you usually get out in the while, still Im rather glad it was behind a persplex window. That suited us right down to the ground! 

{{5080|left}}Then off to the Underwater walk, seals and sharks and rays, and fish galore. Its pretty cool to walk through the tunnels and just experience the vague idea of how large some of these creatures can get and how lethal they can be! Also saw a giant turtle and watersnakes. Then  it was off to see the coral displays and lots and lots and lots of Nemos! We had enough time to go around again so we sneaked under the barrier and went back round! Naughty but definately worth it - remind me to never go to these kind of places again in the middle of the school holidays! 
Headin' South                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shot down to [[L2322]] for the crossing over to the South Island spent the day here, chilled out, during the day then crossed over on the ferry !

Great views at sunset !

{{6825|left}}{{6824|right}}

Cycled the afternoon into the beachside campsite, did some Irish Gallic Football training with Paddy...that finished me off after our biking!

{{6826|left}}{{6827|right}}

Spent the evening on the beach with a campfire...!

Little Britain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Next day spun through to Chrichchurch which is the regional capital of [[L2745]], [[L172]]. It is the largest city in the South Island, 


Nice little City, has a look of York, and is the most English of all the cities in NZ so far ! has a real student vibe too as the University had just kicked off for Fresher's week !!
{{6832|left}}{{6830|right}}

had a great afternoon after we left [[L2320]] I biked along with Paddy Aniss and a couple of others the 30k to our camp by the [[L6038]] river, with stunning views over the Alps !{{6835|left}}

while Biking tot he camp, we must have spooked some deer, as a heard of deer galloped over a small hill out of view then back into view as they came up the other side, amazing thing to see...think Jurassic Park... but we were the ones doing the chasing !


Pancakes & Rapids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               To say this was a great day would be an understatement...it was amazing..one of the very best!

I woke up early doors, because of the white water rafting trip, around 6:45 and this was the view that I saw as I poked my sleepy head out of my tent !

{{6833|left}}{{6834|right}}

Had breakfast, packed up my tent, and went up to the hut with the others to go Rafting !


They explained it was a two hour trip coasting down the river at first going through, grades 1-4 then climaxing with two grade 5 rapids, the highest grade rapids you can take people down on commercial trips !

{{6868|centre}}

the trip was awesome, and we managed to stay afloat the entire trip, at one point we were seconds from being sucked into a grade 6 which would have meant certain "flippidge" and everyone going overboard !!

{{6869|left}}{{6870|right}}

We had seen grade 6 rapids at the Hukka falls the other day, and I love ferice water but I wouldn't have wanted to go though that on a boat !



after the trip down the river we went for a short hike around part of the Tekapo Lake, with amazing views of the Alps and the first look from long distance of Mt Cook...

{{6839|left}}{{6837|right}}

after the Hike, a few of us biked the rest of the way in to camp, as this was a bush camp and had no showers, so we dived into the lake when we got there to cool down!

{{6843|left}}{{6844|right}}

totally knackered, Rafting, Hiking, Biking and Swimming all in one day ! 

{{6847|left}}{{6848|right}}

we topped the day off with Pancakes, a cold beer and the best sunset I have ever seen.

New Year in Sydney - worth the wait                                                                                                                                                                                                                             After arriving in [[L12]] on the 16th of September suddenly it was new years eve.  Now one of the main reasons that we chose Melbourne over [[L1031]] to call our home was the opportunity to be in [[L1031]] for new year.  Was it worth it?  YES!  Would we do it again, not very likely.  We knew what to expect but you do not really expect it until you see it.  Priya, myself, Trish, and our housemates Nitya and Vidya arrived at 6.00pm and already the crowds were absolutely crazy, we managed to find a place selling cases of wine and a seat (the floor) in [[L1031]] Harbour so we were prepared for the next 6 hours. 

{{5113|left}} It got busier and busier, and we got a little more tipsy every hour.  At 9.00pm they put on a show for the children.  This was supposed to have a Wizard of Oz theme but we could not work it out, still it broke the waiting up and it was a good display in its own right.  Anyway, after a few hour-long round trips to the toilets and our Friend Trish feeling ropey 10 minutes before the magical midnight hour the display started.  It was in a word fantastic.  

It was a 360 degree firework display with rockets launched from boats, bridges and skyscrapers all in the setting of one of the worlds best cities.  {{5119|right}}
  We loved it, the crowds loved it and the atmosphere was unreal.  One million people transfixed for a good five minutes - great stuff.  As I said before, we will never do it again as you get to see more on the tv without the hassles but I would recommend everybody who gets the chance to do this once.  What a way to start 2007!  
Catching up with Tim! - Another year older.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     That time has arrived - I have officially aged another year but mentally regressed - at least thats what I tell myself when I look in the mirror and see that I'm am now getting wrinkles and have acumulated a hundred more grey Hairs, yes thats right, more grey hairs!!!! Arghhhh!

{{5093|left}}  Despite missing my family and friends so much, I did actually have a wonderful time for my birthday! I was even working for the day, but it was nice to have Tim meet me for lunch as he had a week off for the holidays....lucky so and so! And when I got home, I was presented with the most beutiful flowers I have ever seen in all my life - it puts the Orchid Garden in Singapore to shame! Beautiful turquoise(brithday colour and gem) and purple/blue orchids (fave colours and flower) and pink lillies (fave flower #2) - Tim must have done his homework because he deinately gets 10 out of 10 for effort and result! I also got taken out by Tim and Trish for a birthday meal at [[L5645]] down the local chippy! Really, thats where we went! Actually it was called GarFish and its basically a renowned chippy as it is a gourmet seafood restaurant specialising of course in Battered Fish and Chips amongst other things! Yummy! Then it was home to bed after a couple of glasses from my bottle of champagne from Tim! Moet and Chandon none the less - I guess this one is a keeper!!!! 
Mt Cook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This is the closest my map would go to My Cook, its a bit inland from here...

{{6852|left}}{{6853|right}}
Anyway...We drove out to Mt Cook Nt Park which is basically the highest Mountain in NZ and is the centre piece of the Southern Alps,
{{6854|left}}{{6860|right}}
We didn't climb it ! we just did a walk through a pass across a few rope bridges across the icy streams that flow through the gorges, and then down the valley to the lakes, which have small ice bergs floating in them, the water looks warm, as it was bright sunshine and a warm day, but the water was as fresh as it comes !!
{{6855|left}}{{6856|right}}
We had our lunch by the lake and all tried to stand in the lake for the longest before the water almost froze them off !!

{{6857|left}}{{6858|right}}
Fiordland                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arrived in the most stunning part of Nz so far, we arrive in the Fiordland Nt park famous for the Milford Sound, we saw the amazing Fiordlands in the late afternoon after a long drive to get there.
{{7158|left}}{{7157|right}}
Camped up in the area but they had had rain the night before so the infamous sand flies were out in force and our feeble insect repellent was about as much use as a chocolate teapot !
{{7159|left}}{{7160|right}}
{{7161|left}}{{7162|right}}
Anyway the nest day we did "the best bike ride in the world" the 12 km downhill ride from the Homer Tunnel down to the Milford Sound, it didn't take long as we flew down the hill, slowing up only to see the amazing scenery along the way !!
{{7165|left}}{{7163|right}}
{{7164|left}}{{7166|right}}

We biked down to the Sound, and took a boat cruise on the water, the only way to fully see the scenery, really amazing and totally un-photographable, brilliant weather too, considering this is the wettest place in NZ, We had great sunshine !
{{7167|left}}{{7168|right}}
{{7169|left}}{{7170|right}}
One of the most amazing places in the world, if you visit NZ you have to get down to this neck of the woods!

The Routeburn track                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Set off on the Routeburn track...

{{7176|left}}{{7177|right}}
A three day hike from the Divide through to Queenstown, 

we stayed in these huts that were just concrete tents ! we had to carry everything, sleeping bags, gas cookers, food you name it we carried it !!

{{7179|left}}{{7180|right}}
JP even managed to sneak a rock into Paddy's back which he then carried the whole first day and only found in the evening !! ha-ha everyone including Paddy was laughing at that one !!

Everyone looked the part, apart from Paddy who looked like he was running away from home rather than going hiking for three days !
{{7181|left}}{{7182|right}}
Had a great time, & good weather, the first day was really warm and sunny, I was in a different hut to most of the party so I walked on my own for a couple of hours to reach it, really amazing walking through the rainforest alone ! total silence, a strange thing when your with 20 people every minute of the day!

got some guy who I passed at this 80 meter waterfall to take my photo !

Reached my hut chilled out !

In the morning it was lashing it down with rain, I just waited around for the others to catch me up who stayed in the previous hut,  they were pretty wet, but we set off...loads of mist and humidity but no more rain for now...So hiring that Gore-tex jacket was a waste of time !!
{{7183|left}}{{7184|right}}
{{7186|left}}{{7187|right}}
Had a good hike, probably good it was a cold day as it was a long trek, over 8 hours most of it uphill !!
{{7189|left}}{{7190|right}}

Spent the night in another hut, with only a 2 hour walk the following morning to finish off !

had a really good laugh in the hut all huddled round the fire ! trying to burn all our rubbish as we had to carry everything out of the route, so our bags were starting to stink !

{{7192|left}}{{7193|right}}

Final day greeted us with awesome sunshine from daybreak, although it was still a bit cool until mid-morning !

{{7194|left}}{{7195|right}}
Reached the End ..Tired..and Hungry for something other than Porrige or Dried Pasta !
{{7196|left}}{{7197|right}}

Passing through                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Rolled through [[L5527]] on our way to Punakaki, on the way through we saw the valley full of mist and low lying cloud, with the sun shining through...

{{7484|left}}{{7485|right}}
{{7480|left}}
Pancake Rocks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Stayed in [[L5525]] for 2 nights, had 2 great nights in the pub playing pool and having a few beers...

saw the Pancake rocks...and did a mountain bike trail with Dagmar...we rode up through a track in the forest to a place called Cave Canyon...one of the most unbelievable sights I've seen this trip...

The canyon was deep down beneath two sides of the valley, and only fills up during a flood, so it was a dry river bed, that had become overgrown with some of the stunning flora and fauna from the surrounding forest. it was cold as it was shaded from the sun, so even on a red hot day we could see our breath in the air..the place was errie and very mysterious..could easily have been used in a film...there was a plaque warning that 10 people drowned here 12 years before from the flood water raging through the caves then into the canyon...so we didn't hang around too long...

Arrived at a camp site just outside of Abel Tasmen Nt park, ideal place...called Old MacDonald's farm...cycled the 40k into the camp with my biking buddies for the last time...we arrived hot and sweaty and jumped right into the river to cool down !

played volley ball in the evening until the sun went down! Oliver had my in stitches with his usual French laugh and stupid jokes while we were playing !!! the fact that Keith was hit in the face twice by his own team mates made it all the more amusing...

{{7497|left}}{{7496|right}}



Went out in the morning with Paddy and Birgeet !and got a water Taxi up to Bark bay, the most amazing beach I've seen on my travels, we dived right into the water on landing at the beach !

then started our 6 hour walk back to the camp...stopping a couple of times for a swim to cool off !

all got wet feet crossing the "low tide" short cut, Paddy got blisters soon after & carried on in bare feet...I mean who goes on a six hour walk with no socks...



{{7494|left}} {{7493|right}}

Got back to camp and went for a meal and drinks  for the last time as a group !

The following morning we drove up to Picton where several of the gang got of the bus and went their separate ways...we'd had 4 quality weeks the best bits of my trip so far, shame to break it all up, but all good things have to come to an end!



Have been offered a job on the next tour though, as one of the guides, which I've accepted should be a great way of earning a few dollars...and beats sitting in an Office temping...


I've had to sacrifice something else in [[L12]] for that and have had to let someone down big-time...but the lure of a job was to great when Im pretty much skint after over 4 months without working...& its not every day you get offered a job without applying for it, so I couldn't walk awayfrom this opportunity! plus its a pretty cool job touring NZ hiking, camping, swimming in the sea etc...and the occasional sky dive for free wont go a miss...
The Great Bondi to Coogee Walk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  {{5128|left}}Theres no rest for the wicked as they say; after the fun at Christmas, New Year and the all the rest, it was time to work off some those excess pounds. We met Trish a little later than planned (as per the norm!) in the city and got ourselves onto the beloved 333 prepay bus to [[L6073]] Beach and got off by the cliffs. This was the first experience of [[L6073]] for Tim, and so he was quite taken by just how many people can fit into one beach! I showed Tim where I worked for a month - now he could appreciate the view I had! From where I sat, I could see the entire length of the beach and getting there at before 8am meant that I could see [[L6073]] for what it really is. And it is a beautiful beach with some fantastic waves! However, add in hundreds of tourists, even thousands on some days, and it can seem quite claustrophobic and a place where if youre not a sun worshipper, you just dont belong! Anyway, we chilled here for a while and soaked up the sun before we walked the whole beach, trying very hard to avoid geting sand in people's faces as we tried to make our way from one end of the beach to the other; and up the steps to lead onto the ocean walk to Coogee Beach. 

{{5131|right}}The walk itself is very relaxing, but it is a long one, and before you know it you are overlooking the cliff tops and looking straight over the edge to see nothing but the sea and its vastness! Then of course you can head off and find yourselves some little lookoutpoints. After we crossed some more cliff tops and a huge old graveyard, we found ourselves in an abandoned cove. The scenery along the whole way is stunning and its surprising to know that its all only a stones throw away! We finally got to Coogee, a little cold and tired! The little workout was certainly much needed! But then it was time for home to get changed and treat urselves to a curry and a couple of beers for our hard efforts!

The Day before we got frosty with the Ice [[L5253]], we visited a small place called Hasst, a the town was a right dive, I biked into to town with Paddy and Aniss, cycling over 50 miles to get there....before that we visited the blue pools, an idyllic spot off the beaten track and had a stone skimming contest....
{{7465|left}}{{7468|right}}

The we left the town as quick as possible and went to the beach, the weirdest beach ever, so strewn with an unbelievable amount drift wood it looked like some sort of mahogany apocalypse, enough tree trunks and logs to build 20 houses...Paddys bright idea was to take it all back to [[L64]] and sell it...


Rolled on into the town of Fox, to visit the [[L5253]], we walked 2 hours through some of the temperate rain forest to get to a spot where the [[L5253]] is assessable, its one of only 2 places on earth where there is a [[L5253]] accessible to the public like this, and the only place it is surrounded by rain forest !
{{7469|left}}{{7471|right}}
Stuck our Crampons on and then jumped onto the ice...walked halfway up...didn't get the chance to see the Ice Caves, as they are too far, you need the helicopter ride for that...maybe next time...

Had a great time ice climbing/hiking, and got some great photos...

the dirt you can see on the ice, is Stone and rock that is ground into a fine dust by the ice as it moves slowly but unstoppably through the valley...

I treated him to breakfast, we agreed to 5000Cfa for the day plus gas, and we got on the road.  We drove 15 Km north to Calavi, hired a pirogue, and spent 4 hours out on Lake Nokoue.

{{7662|left}}{{7661|right}}[[L6080]] was started in the 18th century by the Tofinu to escape from the Fon, who had taboos against venturing on water.  It has grown to over 30,000 inhabitants, all dependant on three recent artesian wells. 

{{7659|left}}{{7658|right}}There is no plumbing here, so residents fetch their own...sewage I will leave to your imagination.  Most of the houses sit on stilts, the lake barely a meter deep here.  In places there is solid land.

{{7657|left}}{{7673|right}}Most of the residents are still involved with fishing, but tourism is obviously making inroads.  The boat tours are sufficiently well-organized to feature three venues where local crafts are sold.

{{7665|center}}The residents are not all hardened to the tourist trade, and my camera was waved off more than once. Like [[L3173]] stars they would like to be famous, but without the invasion of their privacy.  I understand their ambivelence.

{{7666|center}}Casimo brought me by the house to meet his family on our way back into town. We caught his two sons at home, and his wife at the coiffure, before heading over to his brother's house nearby.  There I was treated to a large glass of palm wine where a small taste would have done, and heard of Mathieu's difficulty financing a year's study abroad to finish his legal training.  I left him my email address.  The massive headache that ensued did nothing to keep me awake when I got back to CODIAM.

The following day I spent hours negotiating prices for presents at the artisan village, then got Casimo's help in finding a car to get me and my stuff to the airport, handed him all my extra food and money, and got on the midnight Air [[L79]] flight for [[L1590]].  Dinner was exquisite, the wine not bad at all, and just like that I stepped out of the developing world.  We flew my entire trip in 3 hours and I saw none of it in the dark.  I was going home to my girls.

The sky is grey or [[L3083]] in March, the sun just a glimmering disk, the heat tolerable.  The humidity will suck the life from you, however.  This is the scene of Robert Wilson’s great detective stories and it is not difficult to view the city as darkly as he does.  

{{7671|center}}The whites are barricaded in [[L5853]] in the shadow of the Maggi water tower amid the embassies and the Chinese and Moroccan restaurants and supermarches.  The airport is right there should withdrawal ever be required.  Their relationship to the blacks is good enough, but there is no question who has the money and who wants it.  

{{7669|center}}The city operates by moto-taxi.  It is too humid for bicycles and too big to walk.  A moto is cheap and maneuverable in traffic and comfortable enough, the breeze sufficient to ward off the sweat.  The cloud of oily blue smoke spewed at every traffic light is unfortunately what you breathe however.  An enterprising moto-taxi driver will station himself at a travel agency or the Chinois or the bank, and if he can find a tourist who doesn’t yet know the prices and here for more than just a day, he can latch on for the ride.  This is how I met Casimo, outside the Air [[L79]] office.

{{7667|center}}Casimo is in his early thirties, a little heavy, a little aggressive.  He wanted 1000Cfa for a 250Cfa ride and I had to walk away before he relented.  He handled traffic with the same relentless attitude, and I decided to like him, but the issue was out of my hands in any case.  A day after he gave me a ride I found him stationed outside CODIAM where I was staying, and it was clear I had been adopted.

{{7668|center}}Casimo overcharged me the second day, taking advantage of the fact that I didn’t know where to go to find a bike box.  We made a number of stops in our search, finding the box at a big appliance store and hauling it back to CODIAM with it tucked under my arm.  Viewed from the side we looked like a box and two heads magically gliding down the street with no visible means of propulsion.

When I figured out I was being overcharged (he thought I wouldn’t?), I told Casimo he could keep the money if he gave me a tour of the entire city.  We stopped at the Port de Peche so that I could get caught taking prohibited photos, then out to the point at Plakodji Plage when they kicked us out.

This type of guide gives you the impression he might just leave you in the desert on a whim, and I have read enough to understand it isn't out of the question.  The two guides I had the pleasure to meet were nothing like this, and it is my pleasure to recommend them to anyone interested in visiting [[L5]].

Ahmed Labchek (evasiondune@hotmail.com) is based in [[L5904]] and with Wolf Gaudlitz solved my little can't-get-myself-into-the-country problem at the Tunisian border.  Ahmed took his job very seriously indeed, meticulously handling all of the paperwork and never hesitating to place himself firmly between his paying clients (that would be Wolf and I) and trouble of any sort.  Bureaucrats, customs officials, border police, unscrupulous truckers and the Guardia National all felt a little of Ahmed's sting when they posed a threat to our equipment, our plans or our person, and he earned from me a tremendous feeling of respect. His addiction to making and drinking tea, his incessant need for sleep, and his stories about driving second hand cars across the desert for sale in [[L161]] were extremely endearing.
{{6615|center}}
Abjau Intalla (tinakachker@yahoo.fr) is a good friend of Lakhdar in [[L5709]] and drove us around over several days there.  Talla impressed me with his open and friendly manner, his experience and knowledge of southern [[L5]], and most of all the ethic he brought to his daily interactions.  When challanged to describe who he knew where, and where he had been in Africa, Talla remained honest and straightforward, tempted not at all to embellish his accomplishments.  When offered European cakes as a dessert after cooking a fabulous [[L5]]n meal he demurred gracefully, saying only that it would not be appropriate after such a feast.  Here is a guy unhesitatingly guided by a powerful sense of right, a characteristic I find frankly pretty rare and one that earns from me as well both confidence and respect.  For anyone considering a journey in south central [[L5]] I recommend Talla without reservation.



Food                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This blog may inadvertently have conveyed the impression that food only instigates diarrhea, and that would be a tragic miscommunication.  Bacteria cause diarrhea, not food.  Remember that.

I have had memorable meals in my life, some simple and some grand: a blowfish we caught and cooked off Cape Cod when I was a kid comes to mind, some wine and bread and cheese with my mom when I was a teenager, a vegetable tagine cooked in the sand at Casablanca 28 years ago, a Russian meal with a lot of frozen vodka in North Carolina in 1984, a Japanese meal with lots of hot sake in Lima, Peru a year earlier, a fondue I had in Switzerland in 1990 (booze again), a birthday meal Polly cooked me once on the hottest day of the year in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sushi fests at my sister’s house…the circumstances and the people and the food and sometimes the occasion conspired to elevate the experience beyond simply “dinner”.
{{7731|center}}
The meal Nassir and friends cooked us in the desert at La Source in Algeria, and the farewell dinner Lakhdar and Talla cooked in the desert outside Tamanrasset may well join the list, and both of them centered on bread.  Nassir made real Sahara bread: balls of dough kneaded and massaged into flat patties and fried on a skillet with plenty of oil brushed on.  It came with roasted mutton and a big salad, and the night was clear and not quite as late as usual, and I understood more than a little of the conversation, and out of all of the late night, meat roasting, guy-a-thons, this one sticks in my mind.  That bread was unforgettable.

Lakhdar spent an incredibly long time stirring a bowl of dough that was then poured on a bed of hot sand and embers and covered with hot embers.  The resultant flat loaf was then scraped of cinder, broken into little bits, and mixed into a bowl of ingredients I do not remember (I’m hoping Lakhdar will help me out here with some comments).  This is a traditional meal with a name I also neglected to write down (help me, someone!).  Everyone ate out of the common bowl, with Talla pulling pieces of mutton off the bone and tossing it into each person’s quadrant: a ritual I rather liked.
{{5913|center}}
I must mention tea, and I’m not talking Lipton though that is exactly what got me through some hot afternoons in Benin.  In Algeria especially, tea is ritual: a soothing and relaxing and rather lengthy endeavor requiring several pots and glasses and a small brazier.  A small fire is made in the brazier to yield coals that boil water in a copper pot.  Kasem Chermel at 
So long Sydney                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  {{6438|right}}And like that our time in [[L1031]] is over.  After approximately 4 months in this beautiful city it is time for us to leave.  Both Priya and I have said goodbye to the working life - again! Wished Trish all of the best in Melbourne and packed our things up.  With only one thing to do.... Go for a slap up meal at cafe [[L1031]] care of my brother and sister in-law.  Thanks for that one Paul, the food was fantastic and it was a fitting end to our time in one of the greatest cities on earth. You could argue that since we were in Melbourne we have not really travelled.  However, every traveller will know that it is an expensive business and without the required funds to enjoy the countries that you visit, you are always worrying more about the bank account than where you are off to next.  [[L1031]] has given us an opportunity to be able to enjoy the rest of our trip, whilst at the same time experiencing a different lifestyle to what either of us had experienced before.  As I have already said, [[L1031]] was a great place to base ourselves for such a long perid.  Special thanks need to go to our longest-term housemates; Nitya and Vidya, who were an absolute delight to live with; and of course, to the friends we have made along the way in [[L1031]] too who have all kept us entertained and made sure we did not go too long without going out for a few drinks.  And finally to our house at 97 William Henry Street which made us feel like we had a home away from home.

With the room empty and the bags packed (again) we were ready to start travelling [[L12]] proper.  First stop up the East Coast, the backpackers paradise known as Byron....
Back on the road in Byron                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No messing around with our first trip back travelling.  After a 10 hour bus journey to [[L5583]], we found ourselves transported back to the lifestyle of Koh Tao! We liked this little surfer town, the beautiful beaches and (apparently) excellent surf all gave it a very relaxed feel. Really friendly locals, plenty of cafes, and small hippy shops and loads of surf shops just made this is a perfect location for relaxing and taking it easy! 

Unfortunately it was just a shame that we were still a little homesick from [[L1031]] and all our friends - it took a little while for us to settle back into the backpacker frame of mind, especially since we threw ourselves into the deep end and stayed at a party backpackers in a dorm! To be fair, the girls we were sharing with were really nice, and we all had a little giggle. It was just weird to think that only a few days ago, Tim and I were stil working and leading a very different life in [[L1031]]. 

[[L5583]] though, as we've said, is a very nice little beachside town. Excellent soft sand with clear blue seas, and we were fortunate enough to have plenty of sunshine, which meant plenty of time to bake in the sun! Besides we had a lot catching up to do on the sun-tan front compared to all the other travellers in the backpackers! We strolled to the viewpoint at the far end of one side of the beach and got some amazing views of the beach and the lighthouse - which apparantly sits on the most easternly point of Oz. We also found ourselves the nicest fish and chips restaurant and treated ourselves to one of their renowned gourmet dishes! Fish and Chips! Yummy! 

Next stop....[[L1033]]. 
Blue Mountains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  {{6190|left}}With time fast running out in [[L1031]] we realised we had to start getting out more (other than the pub and cole's!). With this in mind we decided to spend our last Sunday living in [[L1031]] in the [[L6097]]s. After some research we realised that the best and the cheapest way to get there was by train and then to use the free bus system that they have to get around the place. 

We arrived at 10.00am to a beautiful but quite chilly morning. The first thing we needed to do was get on the bright red double decker London bus, which was to be our form of transport for the day. Through the course of the day we saw and learned many things. The first was that a chilly morning can quickly be replaced by a very hot mid-day and afternoon. The second was the fact that the [[L6097]]s are so-called because of the natural oil vapour that the Eucalyptus tree's give off into the atmosphere. This then, creates a blue haze when the sun is shining. I thought that this was a bit of cheek in all honesty, as the mountains themselves were beautiful but sadly not blue. 

{{6186|right}}Finally we saw an array of awesome scenery and stunning landscapes, the most photogenic of which being the (quite) famous Three Sisters. There is an Aboriginal story which gives rise to their name which unfortunately fails to stick in my memory but they are nonetheless a beautiful sight. Even Priya realised this after we had spent almost an hour trekking to get to the face of the rocks and she didnt realise we were at the base of them until the penny dropped five minutes later!

If you are ever in the [[L1031]] area then a trip to the [[L6097]]s is really worthwhile. If you are a "walker" then it is an absolute must. Be warned though that some of the treks can last for 5 days. We just did most of the short walks around the immediate area and saw some nice little pools and waterfalls and walked around the [[L6097]] town of Katoomba. Both Priya and I had a really good day out and it gave us a sense of adventure in preparation for hitting the road again, which without realising it was a matter of days away!
Melbourne Once More                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I took the opportunity to visit some family friends in Melbourne in the weekend just gone, as I didnt get the chance to see them the first time that Tim and I visited! So on the Saturday I made my way over and got to the train station to be met by my Uncle Pat and Aunty Yvonne who have been in my life since the day I was born! They recently came over to Melbourne from [[L2776]] as their sons and their families now live here in [[L12]]. I've grown up with these boys not that they're boys any more! So Im really looking forward to seeing them all again! In the evening I met with another Aunty and her daughter, Tesse and [[L3334]] and we had a nice dinner before heading over to see Aunty Yvonne and Uncle's son Brian. The whole family were together and so we had a good time catching up. Mum and Dad, I have a few photos of everyone, so it should bring a smile on your face and you can see how quick the kids have grown up!!!

Sunday, we went to the market and Aunty and Uncle also took me to the Indian District for a lite bite at lunch before heading to their other sons' place, Mark.  We also went out for dinner at a Thai place in town - I think we've mentioned it before in our blog but Melbourne does have some awesome restaurants and they really are not that expensive! On Monday, Aunty, Uncle, myself and Brian's kids Nathan and Justin, we all went to see the Austalian Open courtesy of Brian's lovely wife, Jessica! (Thank you so much Jess!) We had our corporate seats and got to watch both the mens and one of the womens quarter finals! I had an excellent day out and the boys kindly got me a huge souvenir in the form of a giant inflatable tennis ball! Not sure how I'm gonna carry that home yet!!! It was a shame that we had to leave but I had to get to the airport and most importantly I had to get back to Tim - I missed him so much!!! And besides, he needs me to make his cup of tea in the morning!!!

BrisVegas!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [[L1033]] -  Everyone that we spoke to were not that impressed with [[L1033]] as it was just another city and when you're on the East Coast, all you want is the sun, sea, sand and surf! So, we were not expecting much; but we quite enjoyed the place as soon as we got there so we decided that we would extend our stay for another two nights. For Tim and I, [[L1033]] was the third city we had visited in [[L12]] so we wanted to give it a chance, and anyway I had my eye on doing the Koala Sanctuary which is nearby! 

We were staying at the Palace Central Backpackers which is basically as central as you can be in [[L1033]]! We had arrived around midday but it was an early start from Byron, so we jumped on the internet before checking in and then when our room was ready we promptly fell asleep! Still not used to the backpacker life! We went out for dinner (thank you Aporto's!) and watched the football at this cool little venue; basically [[L1033]] has a some bars and restaurants in the middle of their shopping lanes, between all the shops and malls. You might think this would be the right mix for noise and idiots drunkurds in the street, but it wasnt like that at all, there was a really relaxed attitude and everyone was just out for a laugh, so there was a good atmosphere for the football match!

{{6451|left}}The next day, we wisited the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Basically this is [[L12]]'s biggest Koala sanctuary for injured or endangered koalas, ie, those that have no home left due to the bushfires or those brought in by locals that have been injured from falls etc... The sanctary is definately well run, and you almost get the feeling that you've walked into a small zoo with the amount of carers there are and all the other residents, from freshwater crocs, to emus, and various farm animals. Along with the koalas the other stars of the show would be the reserve full of kangaroos and other marsupials! So finally in one afternoon, we were able to more that fill our quota of [[L12]]n wildlife that we wanted to see! We arrived just in time to see a presentation on koalas and their lives, and then we went around all the various paddocks they had set up for their wallabies, birds, koalas, reptiles and farm animals. We then got to walk with the kangaroos and even sit with them and touch them. But it has to be said that my personal highlight, was getting to hold two koalas and rub noses with them! Tim and I also really enjoyed the Birds of Prey Exhibition in which we got to see [[L12]]'s largest eagle. All in all, this was a
Hervey Bay and the Largest Sand Island in the World!                                                                                                                                                                                                            {{6518|left}}Hervey Bay is a the gateway to the worlds largest sand island. Its a thirty minute ferry ride to Fraser Island and is the ultimate 4x4 driving experience as it is the only way you can get around on the island! When we arrived in Hervey we were not too sure about which company to go with and whether or not we ought to be in a large group of people or by ourselves, so after much debating and listening to others who had already done the tour, it seemed that we were in the right guesthouse to do it from. Everyone we spoke to said they had an awesome time, and that people werent stupid while they were out there, because the guesthouse we were with didnt have the madpartyanimal reputation as next door at Koalas did! Also these guys are the ones that have been doing the tours for backpackers the longest and were surprisingly the cheapest too! So we booked ourselves in for the 3day 2night trip and met the group on the second night of our stay in Hervey after we had been given our brief. It had to be said, the group looked like a good mix of people and us girls felt safe in the knowledge that we had a higher ratio of guys to girls in the group so if we got really stuck in the sand, we had the manpower if not the brains!!!

We soon set off on the third day and picked up our supplies of food and drinks, then got the ferry across and got on our way! First stop, was to get our watertank filled from one of the campsites and then head out to Lake Wabby. An emerald lake next to a steep sand dune! You could litterally slide down the dune and splash into the lake and swim with the catfish, who tickle your feet and legs when you stand still! Strange to find freshwater on a sand island....

We stuck together with the other car from our guesthouse so that when we got to our first campsite and it poured it down, we got the tarp up between the two cars and got a couple of Barbies going! Awesome....it was such a  good atmosphere and we set ourselves up so quick and helped each other out, so we were dry, happy, eating well and even had some music going; whereas the seven other koala cars that pulled up on the same camp site arrived in the dark, couldn't get their tents up because of the rain and the wind, and kept hovering around us for our food - dear or dear!  

The next day we had some rain at lunch but otherwise it was OK, and again had a similar set up for camp as the night before. This time though, we had a beautiful clear night, and the stars made it that much more spectacular! It reminded us of Ha Long Bay in Vie
Airlie Beach and The Whitsunday Islands                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Despite their reputation and the slating we just gave them on Hervey Bay; we stayed at Koalas because its more of a resort and is the best place to stay at in Airlie. Their units all have a kitchenette and a  bathroom and air con and a TV, so again we felt we were back in South East Asia! Just as Hervey is the gateway to Fraser Island, [[L5669]] is the gateway to the Whitsunday Islands.

{{7393|right}}However, instead of a sailing trip around the islands which is what everyone does, we thought we would do something different went fishing. This alternative to sailing is also thanks to our travelling companions, Stace and Kirst who gave us a voucher to use with the best fishing charter there is town! The great thing was that we were also able to still see some of the islands while we were fishing. The views are stunning and the islands again reminded us of [[L240]]. This was also my (Priya's) first fishing trip, so I found it to be a great day, if not a little smelly as we were using pilchards and squids for bait! We saw some turtles and beautiful eagles so that was quite cool! We caught five fish between us but unfortunately we could only keep one for cooking as we were fishing in the protected waters of the barrier reef. It cost $5 to get it prepared, cooked, and served with some chips at a local Fish & Chippy which was definitely a tasty bargain. We had to buy Priya's fish but we shared them both out so we could both enjoy "our" fish. It was a really good day out and we did something that we may not have otherwise got involved with.

The next day was Valentines day, so on the day of lurve....we spent some time on the internet and got our laundry done! We did make a little effort and went out for a meal at one of the indian restaurants, but to be fair, we had our treats the before and it was certainly worth it! Anyway, we couldnt have a late night, as we needed to get up at 4.30am the next day to get our backsides on the bus to [[L5193]]; our final destination up the East Coast. 
Cairns and The Great Barrier Reef                                                                                                                                                                                                                               {{7395|right}}[[L5193]] on first impressions doesnt seem to be much of a grand city, but I guess thats the feel they were going for! Or at least we would like to think so! There is not a single highrise corporate or residential building in sight which isnt a bad thing, but then there isnt anything else which stands out either! However, [[L5193]] does have a great chilled out atmosphere if not for the rowdy locals in pubs and bars, where you are guaranteed a shout out of "Alright Darlin!" every time you pass by! Classy! We are staying in a very chilled out guesthouse which seems to have everything under one roof except for a grocery shop, and as its just on the on the outer city suburbs it is very quiet and relaxed. Its called Dreamtime Travellers Rest, and is very reminiscent of [[L5303]] and [[L48]] Highlands. 

{{7401|left}}Anyway, we sorted out our reef tour with them and went on a boat that came highly recommeded by the guesthouse and other travellers, called Ocean Free. It rained all the way to the reef and the pinnacle that we were mooring up to ( very near Green Island - a resort island with tourist attractons and resort villas), but then it did clear for most of the afternoon which was nice! Tim did two dives and I also managed to do a medium difficulty dive even though I had not passed my certificate - basically I explained what I had done in [[L215]] and that I was confident at medium depths, but I just needed some confidence. So as it turned out, the crew and the main diving instructor guy were incredibly professional and friendly, and he took just me and Tim out first on a dive 12-14 meters depth for just over half an hour. He helped me so much and we got to see just some of the most incredibe waterlife there is that exists! Giant clams, twice the length of me, and coral of all colours and shapes and sizes, great big tuna fish, and plenty of nemos! Countless of other species of marine life and we even got to see some seahorses and pick up sea cumcumbers! Unforgettable! We were so happy with what we got and it was for such a good price. The crew were simply outstanding and paid attention to you, and even ensured that the non-swimmers amongst us had a great day out, and got to snorkel with aid for a bit! Tim had an individual guide on his second dive too, this time for 45 mins, so it was definately worth it. This has definately inspired me to get certified in the UK so that I can enjoy it even more in the future.

Next stop - flight back to [[L1031]]!!! 
We're on our way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                My least favorite part of travelling is the flight.
Back in Sydney, but not for long                                                                                                                                                                                                                                We left the rainy season in [[L5193]] and landed into a beautifully sunny [[L1031]].  Unfortunately we were unable to spend any time enjoying the weather as we had a lot of tasks to complete.  Amongst other things we; closed our bank accounts, applied for our [[L12]]n taxback, bought me (Tim) a book (arguably the most important), booked accomodation for [[L2320]], and managed to meet up with a friend from university who'd recently arrived to [[L1031]] and say a final farewell to our housemates.  All in all a well spent 48 hours.

As previously mentioned we hooked up with a Mr Ryan Martin, who Priya lived next door to in the final year and I spent a year in [[L2298]] with in the third year.  He is in good form, and enjoying [[L12]] and we managed to catch up over a few pints and a meal in chinatown..... I like that stuff!

Fianlly we went back to our old stomping ground at 97 William Henry Street for a final hurrah.  Nitya and Vidya were both in good form, as was Tharany; unfortunately, we didnt get another chance to spend time with John as he was already back in San Fran....look out, there mght still be hope! We enjoyed seeing the house again and catching up with our former housemates, and even in those few hours we were reminded how lucky we'd been. Still, we had been in [[L12]] for FAR too long (especially as the cricket was generally so dreadful) and it was time to set off for pastures new. Next stop, Lord of the rings country, [[L172]].
Country number 9 - Aotearoa - Land of the Long White Cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                      A short flight but a whole different country.  After a three-hour journey from [[L1031]] to [[L2320]], (roughly the same duration as [[L1031]]-Cairns), over the Tasman Sea and the Snow-capped mountains we landed in [[L172]].  On the way to our centrally located Guesthouse, the first thing that struck us was how British [[L2320]] looks, especially compared to [[L1031]].  Half of the trees and plants looked like they'd been stolen from England, which in fact they have.  The weather as well was decidedly cooler than what we'd been used to for the previous 10 months, so it really felt like our first steps home.

{{7420|left}}The other thing that amazed us after our arrival was how many tourists there were in [[L2320]].  We went to the public information centre to enquire about further accomodation and we were basically told we'd find it difficult (we'd only booked our first night).  What followed was about three hours spent walking, phoning, and enquiring as to availabilty for accomodation which was the first time we'd experienced anything like this in all of our time travelling.  Anyway, thanks to I-Site (NZ tourist info office's) we had somewhere to base ourselves for the next few days and instead of really 'explore' [[L2320]] this experience led to us planning the following 30 days of travel.

In all honesty, we did manage to see some of [[L2320]] and it struck us as quite an attractive town (though i think it qualifies as a city in NZ) with its own unique personality.  However, with our (now) 26 days left in NZ we had to hit the road, with the first stop [[L5477]]..
Te Anau - A large lake in a beautiful area                                                                                                                                                                                                                      {{7439|left}}After nearly a full days travel we arrived at another I-site office (a re-occuring theme throughout NZ) at 18.30 to a beautiful lakefront surrounded by mountains.  A quick twenty minute walk to our guesthouse later, followed by the realisation that the shops were due to close soon followed a mad dash almost back to where we'd come from in order to buy supplies.  Our first night in [[L5477]] was spent enjoying a Tuna-Tomato Pasta dinner and fighting the cold. We were just glad we were prepared for the coldness and had just about enough layers to keep warm; at least the guesthouse had heaters too - not something we've been used to so far in our travels!

{{7426|right}}Lake [[L5477]] is [[L172]]s second largest lake and the largest in the South Island, and it is beutifully surrounded by some great mountain ranges of the Southern Alps. With the daytime weather a lot warmer than night-time we took some pre-prepared sandwiches and made off for a walk around the lake.  An afternoons walk with a lakeside picnic was a great day to spend our first full-day exploring [[L172]] countryside, the only downside was the knowledge that we walked to the entrance of one of NZ's most famous walks (a meagre 4 days) without the time to do it as we had to depart for our next destination Milford Sound the very next day. Still, it was great to see the lake, and experience [[L172]]s tramping grounds. 
Its a Fjord not a Sound - Duh! 28/02/2007                                                                                                                                                                                                                       {{7527|left}}I(Tim) have to be honest and admit that I was a bit worried about Milford Sound.  We both wanted to go there but did we want to stay at what is basically and literally the last stop in the road in South East NZ.  The answer was in the end...yes.  The guesthouse was lovely, in a setting which was a mixture between Vang Vien in [[L128]] and [[L5279]] in [[L215]]; though the Sound/Fjord was not visible from our location, we still had fantastic views of the mountains surrounding us and of the river runnng into the fjord. And even though the electricity generator turned off at 11.00pm the place had all of the luxuries we were used to, even that age-old classic battleships (Minus half of the battleships) which Priya very luckily beat me on a number of occassions.  Now, the main reason we were here of course was to see Milford Sound itself, which as the title of this entry suggests is actually a Fjord not a Sound - If you wish to know the exact difference between the two I suggest you use your exstensive internet ability and run a google search.

{{7569|right}}We were going to wait for our second day in the place before we got ourselves involved in a boat tour but the weather forecast was ominous so we departed the afternoon we arrived for a 2 hour and thirty minute cruise of this unbeleivable scenery.  Words cannot really do it justice, but Priya took that into account and took approximately 1 billion photographs (some of which are very good, I have to admit!).  The weather was fantastic, but still very windy  and incredibly cold as we were on an opening to the Tasman Sea - notoriously cold like the North Sea; and the scenery was stunning so it was proabaly the best 150 minutes we've spent since travelling. One of the highlights was when the boat maneuvered its front under a waterfall and gave everone the experience of getting sprayed by the ice-cold pure mountain-fresh springwater - truly fantastic.

Our second day was spent relaxing, reading, eating, walking and packing for our next destination, the Adreniline capital of [[L172]]...... Queenstown.
We like Queenstown we just can't really afford it!                                                                                                                                                                                                              {{7592|right}}Queenstown is another lake-set town surrounded by mountains, the differance here is the plethora of extreme sports one can partake in during your stay.  Now, the initial plan was to do a Bungy jump here, they have the largest in [[L172]] or maybe a skydive.  After a number of days in [[L172]] it was decided that the budget could not cope with any of the "optional extra's" on offer.  This, however did not stop us from enjoying the place, it was a good opportunity to have a meal out, to catch up with Laundry and shopping, and even send some e-mails at a cost of less than 3 pounds an hour.  But our over-riding feeling was that Queenstown is probabgly best enjoyed with a massive budget, failing that, Queenstown would excel during the ski-season, where you can enjoy some amazing skiing and some excellent after-ski, in a town which has everything you need on offer (including the full range of cafe's, fast food chains, and high class resteraunts).  

Our next stop after Queenstown was Franz Josef, which is named by the Austrian explorer who was the first to traverse the area on foot, and named the [[L5253]] and thus the township after his king at the time. Another incredible sight in store!
Franz Josef Glacier, pretty impressive really!                                                                                                                                                                                                                  After another days travel (I wish that [[L172]] did overnight buses) we finally arrived in Frans Josef in the late afternoon.  The most important issue for Priya and I was how we should see the [[L5253]].  Should we do a guided tour on the [[L5253]], a heli-hike on the [[L5253]] or just see the [[L5253]] terminal face (where it stops).  Finances dictated once again and we decided we'd get a shuttle bus to see the [[L5253]] terminal face the next day.

{{7604|center}}

Frans Josef is one of the worlds more remarkable [[L5253]]s as it is incredibly fast moving as it is capable of advancing or retreating by 5 metres a year.  The terminal face of the [[L5253]] is located in a very temperate climate so you have the strange pleasure of walking through rain-forest like growth whilst being able to see a giant frozen [[L5253]].  As I have already stated Priya and I chose to simply see the [[L5253]] and partake in some of the walks around the area.  I do not regret this decision at all as we spent most of the afternoon on a quiet walk to lake wombat.  It is amazing how few people you see during a 3 hour walk in [[L172]], and this just gives you a pleasant feeling of seclusion and adventure. Once we'd finished at the [[L5253]] we had to get back to the guesthouse and pack our things in preparation for one of the highlights of our time in [[L172]] - 2 consecutive days of travel, on arguably two of the most scenic rail journeys in the world.
Train 1 - The Transalpine from Greymouth to Christchurch                                                                                                                                                                                                        After leaving Frans josef at 9.00 in the morning we got to the train station in [[L5526]] 20 minutes before our train was due to leave at 13.45.  Amid a hussle of tourists trying to check in luggage and buy souvenirs we calmly waited for the train to pull up.  {{7619|right}}The first thing we noticed once the train arrived was that it was a simple diesel locamotive pulling 8-10 carriages which were attractive enough but hardly world class, the seats however were comfortable and we were granted ample legroom and the windows are designed to give near-panoramic viewing.  With everything in place the only thing we were worried about was the atrocious weather outside our windows restricting visibility to about 3 metres (weather our bus driver had earlier informed us was "the worst he'd seen in three years").

Was our train journey of a lifetime going to be ruined by the weather?  The answer was no.  The first half of the journey was spent winding through hills and making our way up to arthurs pass which is the centre-point of the southern alpes.{{7620|left}}    At this point the weather was hardly any better but during our brief stop at this point there was literally light at the end of the valley.  We'd been told that the weather on one side of the valley was always differant to the other so we would be very unlucky to get rain for the entire journey.  Well at Arthurs pass we took photo's, one behind us which was grey and grim and foreboding and one in front of us which was clear blue and inviting.   Needless to say the second half of our trip (The more visually spectacular half) was spent on the viewing platform taking in some incredible sights.  Once again I armed Priya with the camera and she managed to take some excellent photo's from the train among the 7 billions or so she took this time.

Overall, a fantastic journey but a long day, and we more-than deserved the two quiet pints of guiness in [[L2320]] and jumbo potato wedges!  One journey dow, one to go but would it be better?

Train 2: The Transcoastal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       {{7935|left}}Another train journey, this time doing the journey from from [[L2320]] to Picton. Awake at 4.30am, picked up at 6.05am, and at the station for 6.30am.  Another train journey, this time doing the journey from from [[L2320]] to Picton known as the transcoastal. This journey does exactly what it says on the tin and traverses the NZ coastline.  We were tired for this journey and we knew we'd struggle to stay awake for the entire journey and to be honest we did catch forty winks but not before seeing some more amazing scenery.

One thing we knew we'd be missing in [[L172]] was whale and/or dolphin watching, the two reasons for this was a 1 week waiting list and finances - rubbish! However, little did we know that we'd get the opportunity to partake in this activity from the viewing deck of our train.  You read that correctly, the transcoastal spends a good portion of its journey no more than 15 metres away from the coastline and with calm flat seas, fantastic weather and show-off acrobatic dolphins it makes for quite an experience.  You not only see the creatures in the water but you see them a number of feet above the water doing flips and somersaults, which is something neither of us will ever forget.  It is a shame that we do not posses a superb camera to even attempt to capture what we were saying but even with one of the worlds best we would still have struggled so unfortunately you are just going to have to take our word for it!

{{7939|center}}

This particular journey lasted for 5 hrs 30 mins and we then had to wait for another bus to take us to [[L5523]].   [[L5523]] is next door to the Marlborough region of [[L172]] and also a popular manufacturer of wines, methinks a wine tour is in the offing!!!
Sun and fun in Paradiso                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         {{7951|left}}Our first night in [[L5523]] was spent relaxing and having a few beers in our guesthouse (entitled Paradiso in case you are wondering about the heading of this trip report).  We were lucky enough to be sharing a room with a Dutch guy who was as interested as we were in getting a good nights sleep so we were in bed by 10.30 pm!  just like being back at school. Besides, we had our wine tour booked for the next day, so it was essential that we got our rest and up early to have a decent breakfast! 

However, the much needed rest really was much needed, and so a decent breakfast wasnt quite what we had, and thus as you will see in the photos, we are looking a little too jovial! As we are aware of, its not often that Tim smiles for the camera with little convincing! That said, the real reason that we really did have fun in the sun, was that on our wine tour, we sampled around 25 wines in th space of five hours, and these tasters were often quite generous! If you think we were going to use the spitoons, think again!

{{7956|right}} The tour itself was very inforamtive and very sociable, it wouldn't be the type of tour you would choose if you are a wine buff. However, for novices like ourselves with a keen interest in wine, as we did pick up a few nice ones in [[L12]] (where funnily enough its cheaper to pick up NZ wines!), the tour proved to be excellent in providing basic knowledge and understanding of fine wines and food, and was also a great way to enjoy the day. We visited a winery first off (Great Escape), and enjoyed a platter of finger food to appreciate what types of food go with which wines, and there was also an opportunity to sample various liquers. After, it off to Brightwater - a vineyard with its own winery where we got to see how the wine is made both the oak barrel methods and the steel barrels. Then we headed to the largest vineyard estate in the [[L5523]] region - Waimea, where we sampled yet more wines, and finally it off to Stafford Lane, a vineyard and olive grove where we sampled various olive oils - tapas style and finished off with...yes you guessed it.....more wines. Homeward bound and it was time to finish our day with a Thai meal before getting some sleep! 
On the Move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Before we arrived into Milford, we were lucky enough to get a scenic tour on the bus as we were travelling.....so just to share this with you, here is one of our favourite photos of the mirror lakes; amongst the stops we made at various pools, waterfalls, lakes, and Gertude's Saddle, a mountain peak. 
{{7513|center}}
Well Well Well - Its Wellywood in Wellington!                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hangover + awful night sleep due to our new drunk dorm-mate + his girl friend he brought back for the night + leaving at 8am to get our ferry ride to the North Island = a very unimpressed Tim and Priya! ;o)

We didnt let our miserable night of no sleep hinder us, and in fact the ferry ride was very enjoyable and comfortable. Instead of the counterpart ferry rides that we had encountered throughtout South East Asia; taking the 'Waitaki' Ferry across the Cook Straight was neither a hair raising thrill on a small and overcrowded vessel nor going at warp-speed! We were in fact on a full size ferry like the ones you would use to cross the english chanel, so we were very happy to board and feast on a cheap but tasty lunch and walk around the ferry to find ourselves a comfy recliner and take a nap! We did view some of the scenery as it is a beautiful crossing to make as you meander gently through the straight, but the temptation of recliner lounge chairs were too much of a temptation for us! 

{{7978|right}}As we pulled into the wharf, we realised we were in a BIG city; if you are in the South Island, what is classed as a city to New Zealanders, is to us in the UK, something the size of [[L2776]] or larger. So to be in a city of a size that Tim and I enjoy being in, it was easy and quick enough to get from the wharf to where we were staying at - a hostel called Wellywood nonetheless!  We familiarised ourselves with the nearby surroundings, and found ourselves a supermarket to get food sorted! And basically just enjoyed our first night in! The next day we took a walk through all the districts of [[L2322]] and found ourselves to be at the right place at the right time to see the Junior Dragon Boat Race which was pretty cool! Then we took the cable car up to the viewpoint in the botanical gardens - this was quite a nice location and possibly one of the nicer botanical gardens we have been to. Not only did they have all the usual unique flora and fauna, but they also had some excellent viewing points, and the place wasnt ridiculously sprawled out over too large an area. So a nice afternoon was had, and a long walk back to the city found us at a cool secondhand bookstore where we picked up a couple of books to chill out with! Sweet As Bro!  
Art Deco City                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {{7986|left}}"Something different" was our plan, so after [[L2322]] we decided that we would take a break from scenery and lakes, and city living and hikes etc... and headed out to a small town called [[L5449]]. 
[[L5449]] is set on the East Coast of the North Island, and is a remarkable place in its own right. The North Island is a newly formed land mass geologically speaking; New Zealanders often feel hundreds of Earthquakes and scientists will mesaure a thousand more! The North Island also features some of the worlds' most spectacular volcanic sites. So what does all this have to do with [[L5449]]??? [[L5449]] was inhabited quite early on by Maori people and later by westerners. As it developed and the western settlement grew into a township by the late 1920's, it was not predicted to be an unsafe area and was relatively level to the sea. However, in the early 1930's [[L5449]] suffered a particularly severe earthquake that measured 7.4 on the Richter scale; the earthquake ripped through the town, and raised up land from beneath the sea several miles out. A fire then gutted what was left of the rubble and debris. {{7994|right}}This leads on to why [[L5449]] is a glimpse of how things used to be....all of [[L5449]] was rebuilt in what was the Art Deco Period, and today much of the architecture remains exactly how it was, including the parks, walkways and the very typically english pebble beach promenade. Up to now, the [[L5449]] Annual Festival, decks every building and every person in the 1930's Art Deco style and fashion; and the whole place is transformed to a past time that locals are clearly quite proud of. 

We really enjoyed [[L5449]] because it really was something different and a chance to enjoy a very different New Zealander lifestyle. We also got the opportunity to visit a working gallery and pay a visit to [[L5449]]s many antique and tribute shops. 
Time to Skydive or not.....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     {{8001|left}}Following the tranquility of [[L5449]], it was off to the Real Adventure Capital of [[L172]] - [[L5494]]. Set on the largest lake of the North Island, [[L5494]] is a growing city that has catered for adventure activities for a very long time. We were eagerly awaiting our arrival to [[L5494]] to get a chance to maybe do a skydive and/or do the Tongariro National Park Crossing. However, when we arrived, we faced the coldest of coldest weathers, plenty of rain and galeforce winds. The day we arrived clearly wasn't going to allow us to do very much at all! To our disappointment, we also found out that the crossing would be closed for the next three days - guess what - thats how long we had. We couldnt believe our luck! We hoped that the weather would pick up but the strong high winds, meant that many skydive operators either were simply not flying or postponing their trips. As for the crossing, it was snowing in the mountains, and visability was zero. A no go for sure! 

{{8004|right}}Financially, it wasnt so bad to take a break and not spend the cash, but it did mean that we wouldnt be able to do [[L5494]] the way we wanted to. However, it did give us the opportunity to make full use of the happy hours on the internet cafes and it also gave us the chance to take the shuttle bus to Huka Falls. One of the biggest falls in [[L172]], that chucks through tonnes of water every second and has the capacity to supply 75% of the North Islands Power or 15% of [[L172]]s total power supply! Quite a waterfall I think you will agree! From Huka Falls we did a little bush walk up the hills and alongside the river; through a spooky pine forestry and the back farms of [[L5494]] to the geo-thermal power station and back again . Again, another excellent afternoon out whilst it had stopped raining so we weren't complaining!  
Natural Gases like the ones you and I can make!                                                                                                                                                                                                                 {{8031|left}}Smelly Smelly Smelly [[L5655]]! If you are not one for foul eggy smells that you certainly are not one for [[L5655]]. This is the place that started [[L172]] tourism, and yes, for its smells! Amongst other things too! [[L5655]] is the thermal land, where the Earths crust lays only 15,000 meters thick before you hit melting hot magma. [[L5655]] is a very beautiful town, and has a relatively relaxed atmosphere due to its abundancy of hot pools and spa resorts. However, wherever there are any of these hot springs, there is also a sulphurous smell about the place, and this can quickly spread to fill the air of the whole city. Standing next to some of the pools is enough to make you want to throw up! 

The thermal villages are world renowned and the hot springs are still places of great importance. For the Maori people that centered themselves around this area, they soon depended on the hot water for culinary purposes and also treated them as luxury hotspots....no surprises there really! But be warned before you dip your toes in, some of these hotsprings if not most of them would actually scald you and scar you for life if you so much as had a droplet touch you! They are really hot and the sound of steam rumbling beneath rocks only prove to you that the Earth's might is small eruption away! 

{{8022|right}}However, [[L5655]] also offers some of the best and purest of Spring Water in NZ. We went to visit one of these Springs - Rainbow Springs which is also where a trout and nature park is set up. Here we got a huge insight into [[L172]]'s native flora and of course the Silver Leaf Ferns, and also got to learn more about Maori culture in relation to the environment. We coupled this visit to the 'Kiwi Encounter' Sanctuary nearby where there is an on-going project to rejunivate the Kiwi population. This in itself was a great experience and we got to see these wonderful nocturnal creatures in their natural surrounds. Strange creatures really - flightless, very long beaks, , but cute nonetheless. For the wellbeing of the Kiwi's, you cannot take any photos of them, so you will have to make do with the taxidermies to get an idea of what they look like! 
Glow Worms Galore                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               {{8041|left}}Another whirlwind of a journey and we found ourselves in Waitomo - a part of the country famous for its cave sites and glow-worms grottos. When we arrived here, it reminded us a lot of Milford Sounds, in the sense that there really is nothing here apart from the land around you and unless you filled your time up caving and exploring, you could only realistically stay here for one or two nights at the most. As it happened, we were here for one night, so as soon as we arrived at the YHA, we booked ourselves on the combo tour of Ruakuri Caves and Waitomo Glow worms Cave. The first tour gave a very indepth look into caving and how they are formed, discovered and developed. We also got a very thorough introduction to the world of the glow-worms....actually they are in their maggot stages when they are able to emit light from their bums (a result of emzyme and other chemical reactions giving out bio-luminescense - told you we learnt something!!!) and then turn into flys with no mouths. Weird huh!!!

{{8053|right}}The second tour was definately one for your average tourist, with well laid chambers and brief introductions to the world of caves and glow-worms, but still just as exciting and certainly just as memorable. Especially with the final part of the tour conducted on a boat in the pitch dark, where as you float down the river through the cave to one of the entrances; you look up and find that there is a blanket of green stars above your head as the cave is lit up with thousands of glow-worms. When you are there, it is quite a sight to take in; but again, due to flash photography disturbing the worms, we could not take any photos of this wonderful underworld! Sorry!
BMail and stuff for the People!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First off, I want to quickly thank all you lot for helping Blogabond take off so quickly.  Our user base doubled over the holidays, and then Doubled AGAIN in February!  Somebody must have been spreading the word.  You guys rock!  

I've been quietly putting new features live for the last few months, and leaving them out there for you all to discover.  So you may have noticed that your blog entries are autosaving themselves behind the scenes, that you can hide your draft entries until you're ready for the world to see them, and that you can add new places to the world map.

But this week, I finally got around to putting up a few major features that have been in the hopper for a long time.  Blogabond was always intended to be a place for Independent Travelers to hang out and share stories, but until recently it's been sorta tough to get a conversation going with anybody on the site.  Sure, you could leave comments on one of their posts, but unless they happened to check it they might never see it.  And if they replied to you, how would you know?

So now, everybody gets a little Mail link next to their name.  You can send private messages to anybody on the site.  If you've got an account, you can check out your Inbox under the My Stuff tab, and if you've given us your Email address we'll even forward along any direct communication that you receive.  So if you read my entry about [[L5020]], [[L145]] and want to know if it's worth going, you can shoot me off a private message and ask me about it.  

We've also got Buddies now.  You've seen this idea before, so I don't need to go into detail, but yeah, you can now start collecting friends on the site and keeping tabs on what they're up to.  Less digging around trying to find stuff.  Thus, more better.

There's another feature teetering at the brink of being pushed live that will let you compliment users on their cool blog entries and photos.  Once we get a bunch of votes for stuff, I'll probably scrap the idea of "Featured Whatever" and just let you guys decide what belongs on the Home page by voting on it.  So if you want to displace The Hulk from his seat of glory, you can organize all your friends to come onto the site and vote on all your stuff.  (Or I guess you could also just let the system work itself out so that things floated to the top on their own merit.  But that might not be as much fun.)

Anyway, thanks again for helping to make Blogabond a reality.  Keep up the suggestions!

Jason
Crossing over                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Crossed over to the North island, the bus was dwindling almost everyone had gone in all directions, bac to London, [[L1590]], Tahiti, The USA etc etc...the gang was gone !

Got to [[L6160]], seemed so weird to be travelling on my own again, didn't really get into the swing of it even in the two days I was here, nice little town though...



Did do much just got a few books, and swapped my flight over...
Wanga-Who'ie?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Moved onto [[L5982]],


Nice Hostel, but full of Italian and German couples in their late 30's cooking Spaghetti Carbonara...not my scene just yet !


Met a few nice people, but most were a bit weird, Met a French girl called [[L79]]...would you call your Child England ? Crazy


Went on a bike ride, but the bile was ancient, a far cry from the decent bikes id been using on the tour...


this side trip wasn't going too well...Was quite bored after the thrill a minute on the Flying Kiwi !
Beachy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Rolled on into [[L6161]], the lonely Planet made it sounds like an idyllic location and the flyer made the beach sounds awesome...

I thought a few days R&R by the beach would do the trick , before I started work...


The beach was awful, grey sand, full of drift wood, and the sea looked less than inviting, suddenly 2 days here seemed too long...

until I met these 3 girls from England ! Liz, Lisa and Naomi who I got on really well with and had some beers and played cards with that night, had a good time,


saw them in the morning at breakfast, and as it was tipping with rain of biblical proportions, I thought a crap town is bad enough, a crap town in the rain is even worse !

So they offered my a lift into [[L2322]], jumped at the chance, and rolled onto Welly with them, even though it was grim there there's heaps more to do...
Wellington Boots                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Welly with the girls, went to the Museum, sat drinking tea while the rained poured down, but had a good laugh with the girls, went to the movies, went swimming with them, great crap weather mates !

Had a good time for a couple of days, cheered me up before worked started !!

The next day work started for the first time in 4 months !

Started by picking up the guys and driving onward and upwards through the North Island towards [[L5319]] and then North towards the Bay of Islands and Pahia !

Had a brake down to cope with, but my first few days of work were going just fine!!

Working Nine to Five                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

First few days were getting better, had had a few freebies too a ride on a jet Boat, a Maori concert ,the morning sand boarding...this jobs a doddle...



A flash of work and loads of freebies...fair enough the hours are long, [[L3190]] till well after sunset, but I'm loving it !

{{8194|center}}I’m cleaning my equipment, packing it in bins, wondering if I’m up for life as it was, or ready to assert some life as it should be.  Powerfully held, these memories of my trip, and I find myself daydreaming a lot: joyful people, isolation, realizing the importance of family and friends. Emails begin to arrive from overseas, and I look forward to the correspondence.  If there is a book in this whole enterprise then it will be fed by this continued repartee.  I’m cataloguing photographs, entering one or two in a competition, looking for new doors to open.
{{8195|center}}My life is in the balance, or so it feels, as I consider where to put my energies.  Polly’s optimism is infectious, laying waste to my caution.  Spring is inexorable: I face it with a sense of hope.
...and what about that bicycle?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 My bicycle frame did need a minor reconfiguration, so I took it back to Independant Fabrications in [[L3268]], MA and they gave me a lesson in customer relations.  Not only did they immediately take my bike, strip it down, sandblast the frame, and prepare it for a new bridge, but Lloyd Graves gave me an hour and a half tour of the facility, handed me a T-shirt and gave me the entire history of the company to boot.  They took the relatively insignificant problem with my frame as seriously as a new customer or a big order, and devoted time and resources probably far in excess of its merits.  This is a shop I feel privileged to have stumbled upon, and I’m glad to be riding their bike.  If there is a twinkle in my eye, perhaps it is that first inkling of where I might want to take it next...

Hard Graft !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Spent a day or so heading down from the Bay of islands to get to [[L5494]], went via Coromandal and Cathedral cove, got to see them again this time drenched in amazing early morning sunshine !

Swam out to a rock just off the shoreline at hot water beach and collected a few mussels, sparked a trend as this group of girls spotted me, 5 minutes later they were, then 5 minutes after that everyone on the beach was gathering them, we cooked them in the evening, really fresh had them the next night too ! new fave food !

spent the next day at my one of my favourite spots, the kick ass beach Whiratoa, the amazing place where there was no one on the beach, I just ran down from the board walk...pulled of my t-shirt, and just jumped right into the sea, instantly deep enough to swim in, and clear enough to see with your eyes open...a true slice of paradise ! looking back as I float on my back all I can see are rolling green hills, and amazing cliffs covered in temperate rain forest...and a golden beach with no one apart from the advancing members of our bus party !
{{6601|left}}{{6600|right}}
Rolled in [[L5494]] another sun-dreched day, took one of our passengers up to bungy jump, a young japansee girl, dont think she knew what she was doing, she seemed to brick it as they strpped her in, and I could hear her scream right down the vally as she plummed towards the lake from the platform 50 meters above !

Spent the afternoon Skydiving ! the ultimate perk...any future job must live up to this...this time I did 15,000 ft and it was even better than before as I could take it in from the second I left the plane, and had a longer free fall ! awsome !!
{{6710|left}}{{6704|right}}
Just before the skydive I went for a dip in the river fed by a thermal water fall, so freezing river water mixed with steaming water from a hot spring, makes a nice bath water style temp !!

but got to see over 150 Dusky Dolphins all playing in the water just off the shore, many jumping doing all sorts of back flips etc...

really cool to see them, in full flow at top speed !

So got to get out and see so much more of the place, Did 3 amazing activities, The Shotover Jet, a Jet boat ride at 85kph through canyons along the Shotover river ! the boat pulls off amazing 360 spins at breakneck speed ! really cool !


{{8482|left}}{{8481|right}}

Also got to go Bungy Jumping, AJ Hackett Kawarau Bridge, really differnt feeling falling off the bridge compared to Skydiving ! id say scarier as you can see the river so close, My upper body even hit the water before the cord pulled me back up almost just as quick !

What up y'alls?

So I skipped out of [[L68]] without riding a single wave. The surf just never materialized, and the town never got any more charming. Two full days in decommissioned Midwestern school busses put me over the border into [[L100]] on to [[L5003]] Ruinas.

[[L5003]]. What can I say? It's spectacular. I can see why people dedicate their whole lives to this sort of thing. I'm sure my pictures won't do the place justice.

I'm now on Roatan, trying to get in a few dives and a suntan. Everybody here speaks English. I feel like I'm cheating.

Bailing from trailworks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Friday will be my last day here.

embellished whatsoever. In fact, I'm convinced that they shot part of it in my room.

Anyway, assuming I'm not knifed to death by pirates tonight, I'll be flying to [[L1031]] tomorrow evening. I think I enjoy the third world best in small 
doses.

I opted out of the luggage equation this time around. I've crammed three months provisions into a little carryon pack. It's cool because I never have to think about what I'm going to wear. Let's see... I've got one pair of shorts and a shirt. I guess I'll wear that!

So yeah, the austrialia leg is all about the jellyfish, with not much in the way of tall rocks to be found. I have the shoes along just in case, but for
the most part I'll be surfing.

I spent a couple nights in [[L1031]], driving on the 
wrong side of the road and working the jetlag out of the system.

Along the way up the coast I bought the most beat up shortboard I could find. I've only had it in the water once, and got thoroughly worked as a 
reward. It's cool not having to wear ten pounds of neoprene to avoid hypothermia, but I sure don't float to the surface as quickly without it. 

And for the record, the toilets do indeed flush in the other direction, and the moon is oriented entirely the wrong way. All in all, good times are 
being had.

Yeah, it's good to hear that the sharks are keeping to their side of the country. We had a strange experience today though. We checked out this semi-crowded break just south of town &amp; decided to go rent a longer board for the small surf. In the twenty minutes it took to find a surf shop and come back, the whole beach had emptied. Nobody was in the water (there were maybe 30 surfers and a crowd of swimmers) and there was a big no swimming sign. I have no idea what happened, but can only assume that somebody saw a shark. Spooky!

Anyway, the good news is that we went a few miles further down &amp; found some great waves. Best of all, no wetsuit! Just trunks and a thin spandex shirt callled a rashguard. Things are definately looking up. 
still alive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I'm up in [[L5007]] now. It's plenty hot, and the water is warm with perfect waves. No more rashguard. I'm just surfing in a pair of shorts now. That was half the goal for the trip, so now I've just got to make it up to Arlie Beach and get certified to dive. That may be the next stop, or we may spend a few days on Fraser island along the way. 
Fraser Island                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {{28|center}}

So I'm in the town of Hervey Bay at the moment, having just returned from a few days on Fraser island. We were pretty much going to give the place a miss, but everybody we ran into kept insisting that we absolutely had to go. They were right.

Basically, you fork over some money and they pile you together into a group of nine strangers and hand you the keys to a big ol' [[L2069]] Landcruiser. Then they toss in about sixty pounds of steak, 30 gallons of beer, and a couple beat up tents. The rest is up to you, and the ferry leaves in an hour.

Fraser is really cool. It's just a giant pile of sand, with a rainforest covering most of it. It has some amazing lakes with white sand bottoms and
incredibly clear, pure water. So pure in fact that you can drink it.

Apart from the beach (which is actually designated as an [[L12]]n highway), there are no roads, just a series of rough tracks through the jungle. 
Now when I say rough, I dont mean just rough, but rough enough that they manage to consistantly bog vehicles designed specifically to never bog down in sand. Loads of fun! Even better with eight nervous passengers screaming in the back.

In short, the best time I've had in [[L12]] thus far. Good times, good company, beautiful place. It's all good. 
Re: Photos from the road                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        {{26|left}}Fraser island is maybe 500k North of [[L1033]], next to the town of Hervey Bay. It's tall &amp; skinny, you can't miss it.

I'm in Airlie Beach right now. It's a bit southeast of [[L1036]], and it's the point where the barrier reef is closest to shore. I'll be in the pool for the next couple days, then living on and diving from a boat out at the reef. Pretty cool! 
The Reef                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        {{27|left}}Hey all. I just got back from three days of diving on the great barrier reef. That, combined with a couple days in the pool &amp; some classwork is 
enough to get a fella certified down here. 

It's a pretty cool operation. Much different than in the states, where there would be dozens of waivers and big warning signs and absolutely no alcohol on the boat. Here, the only piece of advice was &quot;figure out how much alcohol you think you'll need, then double it.&quot; [[L12]] rules!

As to the actual diving, it was great. I did an advanced course on the boat that added a 30m deep dive and a night dive, along with some additional skills. The night dive was really cool. There were dozens of meter long travellies following along at your shoulder. Whenever you'd spot a fish with your dive light, they'd flash past and grab it. It was so much fun that I just spent the rest of the dive spotlighting food for them.

The reef is pretty cool. Lots of big fish, sea turtles, rays and such. I even came up against a 5 foot reef shark.

Anyway, this internet connection has some serious issues, so I'd better get this off while I can. I'm off for [[L215]] in a week, so the next message you get will likely be from there. 
back down the coast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             {{35|left}}Not too much to report since I last wrote. I managed to cram quite a bit of surfing into my last week here, and even got a couple dives in too.

I spent a few nights in Byron Bay on the way back down the coast. It's a pretty cool town with a great beach. They have this funky hostel there that attracts an eclectic subset of the backpacker community. This place has free digeridoo lessons, fire dancing and some really strange accomodations. I slept in a teepee.

Anyway, I'm back in [[L1031]] now, trying to come up with a day's worth of tourism to keep me busy until I fly out tonight. I'm not sure how often I'll be able to check my mail in [[L215]], so you all may get a bit of a break from my lame trip reports for a while. 
Latin Life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      {{66|right}}Been diving.

Been diving lots in fact. Been down to 37 meters, squeezed into caves, Poked fish and been bitten by them. Picked up enough of a tan to make all the co-workers jealous. Time to head back to the mainland.

[[L24]] is the next stop, en route to the Guatemalan highlands and possibly into Mexico for a few days and a few ruins.

In short, it's all good and it's not yet half over.
still alive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     {{68|center}}

So I've accumulated another half dozen passport stamps since the last report. I'm back in [[L93]] now, speaking broken Spanish and climbing Mayan temples. Spent a day at [[L5027]], looking up at big ruins, and looking down from on top of them. Wow. I'm gonna be an archeologist when I grow up.

My tan is starting to fade, so I think the next stop is the beach. A Couple friends are flying into [[L24]] tomorrow, so it's off to Placencia to meet them.

[[L24]] is pretty much a rookie destination. Everything is just a little too easy for the third world. People speak English, Taxi rates are posted, busses run on time and take you where they said they would go. It's hard to adjust to. I'll need to get back out before I get used to it.
the local bus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {{64|left}}Lots has happened since last I wrote, but I'm not going to talk about that just yet. First, you all need to learn more about the joy that is third world travel. I'll recount the story of my bus ride from [[L5012]], [[L93]] to the [[L24]] border.

So we hop on this bus at the station. You can tell that it started its career in some [[L3451]] school district circa 1964. Certainly was taken out of service long before I hit grade school. it's not too crowded, meaning that there is one seat left with only two people on it. I take this one and hang out for roughly an hour while locals pile on and the bus idles in the sun. 
It's 87 degrees outside, and a man is standing in the front of the bus selling some sort of miracle cure at full volume.

Once enough people are aboard that nobody can move anymore, the bus starts moving. It stops a few more times to cram more folks aboard, then one last time so that a guy in a pickup truck can throw a bunch of mail packages in the windows and fill up any additional space.

We continue to pick up passengers along the way, sometimes stopping twice in 50 feet. After about half an hour, I give up my seat to a woman, her baby, her son, and their chicken. I'll be standing for the rest of the trip, 2 more hours to the border. The bus is packed tight enough now that I can no longer fall over. I even manage to fall asleep standing up for a while. Then the pavement ends.

2 1/2 hours, 60 miles, $1.25. In short, a pretty typical bus ride down here. It usually takes about three of them to get from one place to the next.
off the map                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     {{57|center}}

It just got good.

{{58|right}}We (just myself and Zack these days) worked our way to the little village of [[L5026]], [[L93]]. Way off the beaten track, but definitely worth the 3 hours on bad dirt roads from Coban. This place is amazing, complete with waterfalls and cascading pools, caves that go back for 3km, and even some untapped climbing potential.

We blew 3 days there, in a grass hut in a cow pasture, intending to head back to Coban and then bus it down to [[L5326]] and onward to [[L5014]] on the coast. But then, we heard about the secret back way.

Apparently, people had, in the past, come into town from the other direction over a series of unmaintained roads that weren't on any of the maps we had along. Others had left town for [[L5326]] that way, with apparent success. No details were available though, as none of them ever came back. We're there!

First stop was Cahabon, a town remote enough that the sight of westerners is still novel enough to draw stares, pointing, and laughter. We stayed there for a day, and set the alarm for 2:45.

At 3:30am, we hit the road for what was possibly the most interesting travel day of my life. The locals head out for work at 4 in a series of 2 ton farm trucks. We hopped on the one that looked like it was heading the farthest out of town, and rode it as far as it would go. 

The next several hours were spent alternately sitting by the side of the road in remote [[L93]]n jungle, and standing inside or on the bumper of small pickups with up to 30 people in the bed. Eventually we hit the highway (also a dirt road, but straighter), and found a ride to [[L5326]].

28 Hours, 5 rides (one in a truck full of guys with shotguns), 50 miles, $2.50 not including room and board in Cahabon.

I'm in [[L5014]] now, enjoying the Caribbean sun for one last day before heading back to [[L93]] city and home.

Too bad my bag didn't. No worries, the airline says they'll let me know as soon as it turns up somewhere.

So yeah, I've already written it off, but I'll humor them for a couple days before I replace all my stuff. And by all my stuff, I mean ALL my stuff. I've got the clothes I'm wearing, the book that I finished reading on the flight, and an ATM card that expires sometime in the next few weeks. And a Mars bar.

It's all good! 
No worries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The luggage made it. Everything is back to being too easy. 

Made it out bouldering today up at Table mountain. It was cool. I'm starting
to run out of [[L5016]] things to do though. I think I may rent a car and head
up to the rocklands for a while. 
Straight off the streets of CPT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 {{91|center}}

I headed up to the rocklands for a couple days to check out some world-class bouldering, and possibly get eaten by a leopard. The place is pretty cool, loads of rock for miles in any direction, with Mutual of [[L3318]]'s Wild Kingdom living in between. I got on some fun problems, but I kept getting more and more tentative to slap blindly for holds after seeing all the spiders, snakes, and assorded angry critters living in them.

Next stop was Montagu, the western cape's premier sport climbing destination area, and home to absolutely no climbers at the moment. Nobody to climb with, hence no real reason for me to be at the western cape's premier sport climbing destination area. In fact, in the short time I've been down here, I have become convinced that I am the only travelling rock climber in all of [[L197]]. Looks like I'll stick to bouldering.

Anyway, I'll probably tourist up the joint in [[L5016]] for a couple days more before heading east. If I'm feeling lucky, next stop will be Outdoorshoorn and the awesome limestone with likely zero partners to be had. Otherwise, it's off to J-Bay to find some waves.

It remains All Good. 
Stuck at the beach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              {{90|left}}J-Bay lived up to all expectations. Really cool looking waves that I have no business getting in the way of, and plenty of less deadly but equally perfect spots as well. 

I finally got on my first bus today. Everybody has rental cars here, so I've been pretty lucky at finding people who were going in the right direction. Now I'm in Cintsa, at the backpacker's equivilant of a black hole. Everywhere you look, there's a nice hammock in the shade overlooking the beach or the pool, and a friendly barmaid to hand you another 75 cent beer. Laziness beckons at every turn. I don't see how I can possibly escape.
Sorted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Things go well. I spent yesterday on foot, tracking a pack of babboons across Zulu country. In fact, I've been on foot quite a bit in the last week, hiking around in the Drakensberg. The place is truly spectacular, with 1000 meter cliffs to stumble off if you miss a step, deep sandstone gorges to explore, and views that are just a bit too scenic for my tastes.

Before that was [[L2578]], and a few days of surfing in the warm water and sunshine.

Now I'm in [[L5018]], sequestered in a compound surrounded by razor-wire and an electric fence. They take their security seriously down here. This is a good neighborhood, which means that I get to walk around in the daylight. In Jo'burg, you are strongly discouraged from leaving the hostel for any reason.
Watched the sun rise over the Kalahari today...                                                                                                                                                                                                                 {{75|center}}

I finally made it out of [[L197]], one week after my visa expired. I spent those extra couple days out at Kruger park, checking out the wildlife. The place is cool. Animals everywhere. It got so that you wouldn't bother stopping the car because there were only 50 impala on one side and a dozen zebra, some wildebeeste and a few giraffes on the other side.

Yesterday was a travel day, so 8 hours in packed minibus-taxis, and a 14 hour night bus saw me across [[L19]] and up into [[L251]] this morning. Went and checked out [[L3454]] Falls today, and was suitably impressed. The thing is so wide that you can never really see it all, and it drops along this series of gorges so you can walk out the side of one and have this giant waterfall spanning from as wide as you can see, but only 50 yards in front of you, with the spray dropping on you like a torrential rainstorm. Cool.

I've only got a couple weeks before I need to be in [[L2172]], so I'll probably pull out of here tomorrow and start making my way towards [[L145]].
Monkey Bay, Baby!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               That's right, I'm in Freakin' [[L5020]], and there's not a thing any of you lot can do about it. I hereby claim the place as part of the greater Kester empire!

There's too much happiness to relate from my perch here at the bar, so I'll give you the disaster story instead.

So after 12 hours crammed in the back of VW minibusses with 25 locals and their stuff, I pulled into this town for the first time. But I wasn't staying, so I jumped in the back of the last pickup headed out to Cape Mclear. Only maybe 15 of us, but no cage so it was plenty tight. And it was 4wd territory the whole way out.

Anyway, about 10k in, we're halfway up a long hill and the radiator finally gives out. No worries, right. We start rolling back to see what can be done, and that's when the brakes go. We pick up speed. People start hollering. People start jumping out. One guy goes over the hood is riding on it. I'm up on the rail, jettisoning my bag, when the driver cuts the wheel to the side. We slam into the hillside doing about 20, and I do my best flying leap over the side.

I land in a forward roll, and am up and scurrying downhill, expecting to see the truck cartwheeling towards me, but it has dug itself into the side of the hill and dispensed about half of its passengers off the back. Amazingly, nobody was seriously hurt. 

But yeah, Cape Mclear made up for it all. Best place I've found yet in Africa. $1.50 for a room, $0.30 for a beer. Great beach and flat, clear, warm fresh water.

No worries.
Lake Malawi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Over the years, I have learned that if you throw enough money at any problem, it will go away. Last week was no exception. 

With only 3 weeks to make it from Jo'burg to [[L2172]], I knew that I would have to move fast at some point, and probably blow right past some of the things I had wanted to see. I made it into [[L145]] with just over a week to spare, and a quick look at the map verified that I'd be spending most of that week in busses unless I took some drastic measures. In the end, it was an easy decision: [[L145]] is cool. I wanted to see it. I booked a flight.

Good idea. First stop was Cape Mclear, and a few days in [[L3322]], with hardly any other travellers. The few of us there were would throw a couple bucks at the local boys, who would organize a bunch of fish and a duck to roast on the beach after the sun went down. After a couple hours, half the village would be around the fire, passing around cartons of the Chibuku (the local, pulpy, shake &amp; serve brew.)

Next up was a long haul up the coast, with a night stranded in a $0.75 hotel room, finally arriving in Nkata Bay. Yet another beautiful place, but with more of a tourist feel. There were bungalows right on the lake, good meals, good times, and I actually managed to spend more than ten dollars a day. Quite a feat for [[L145]]. 

Anyway, I'm stuck in [[L2205]] today, trying to verify that I do indeed still have this flight tomorrow. Next stop is [[L120]] and [[L228]].
RE: Sad news from the 7th floor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I'm in [[L2172]] now, trying to hook up with my Father, who is flying in tomorrow. I made the mistake of letting him pick the hotel, and he found one dead center in the sketchiest area of town. They were beating a guy in the street when we rolled up, and while we were waiting for that to clear, a couple prostitutes came over and tried to get into the cab. Needless to say, I slipped the driver another couple hundred shillings &amp; we dusted off in search of better digs.

Now, I have to intercept the Pop at the airport, before he hails a cab towards certain death.
Masai Mara                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Got charged by a Rhino a couple days ago. Yeah, I'm in full safari mode now. I spent the last week at a few parks in [[L120]], and now I'm in [[L228]] for the Serengetti and a few others.

The only problem, if you can call it that, is that you're pretty much forced to stay at all the luxury safari lodges at all the parks. There's camping outside the gate but it's not really any cheaper since it's the low season, the lodge rates are way down. So everywhere I go, there's somebody handing me another mango juice and watching to see if I set my fork down so they can polish it for me. It manages to nicely combine the two things I hate most in this world: Being waited on, and feeling like a tourist.

Anyway, it's only for another week so I think I can survive.
Too much metal for one hand!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I am officially safari'd out. Lemme off. I'm on the first bus to [[L2686]] tomorrow, then on a boat to [[L2687]] to get my tan back. In the meantime, I'm still sequestered away at the luxury lodge outside of town, with no Hope of interacting with the local populace. I hopped the fence and made it into town, but I'm sure I'll be missed. They've probably sent somebody to escort me back.

Anyway, Africa still rules. I'm just not convinced that [[L120]] and [[L228]] qualify as Africa anymore. It feels more like disneyland. 
Z'bar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Now we're getting somewhere.

For two weeks, I was convinced that both [[L120]] and [[L228]] were lost causes. Anywhere you want to go is overrun by the tourist industry, and any westerner is just a big sack of cash for the locals to harass. 

[[L2687]] town is a definite step forward. There's still the full-court press in the market and near the tourist shops, but you can get away from it and get lost in the back alleys of a pretty cool town. It's like 4000 years old and all funky winding alleyways between ancient stone buildings with intricately carved ebony doorways. Sun and nice beaches on the shore, shade and cool breezes blowing smells from the spice markets through the streets. Yeah, I can deal with this.

The rest of the island is supposed to be your standard-issue tropical [[L3322]], completely ravaged by tourism. I'm bracing for the worst.
Z'beach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I was mistaken. The beach up at Nungwi is awesome. You should see my tan... 
Out of Africa                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   {{86|center}}

Check me out, I'm walkin' around in an African capital city at night, and I haven't been robbed, beaten or killed even once. Nobody is following me around trying to sell me jewelry and wood carvings. No crime, no hassles. Civil war is your friend. 

Not to worry, I'm sure that this place will turn into another [[L5021]] inside of ten years. But for now, everybody's just too happy that the war is over to think about exploiting the few tourists that are coming in.

So yeah, [[L230]] gets the thumbs up. Too bad I've got to leave tomorrow. It's off to [[L5121]] and [[L5109]] next. Here's the final Africa tally:

8 countries
75 days
20 hot showers
140 hours in busses
12 hours swimming in bilharzia contaminated water
30 rhino sighted
4 class 5 rapids rafted
2 flights
15 varieties of local beer

Good value!
Cha!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My hotel room has a little arrow on the dresser so that I'll know the direction to [[L5156]]. Outside my door was the morning paper in Arabic. Today I shall swim in the Persian Gulf.

Life is good.
Beer Run                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        {{1182|right}}Part of the appeal of travel for me is that you tend to find yourself in really strange situations from time to time. Big cities in the third world seem to be especially good for this. [[L5109]] has not disappointed.

I've only been here a few hours now, but already I've found myself in a custody battle between two pensionnes in the same building, each claiming to be the Dahab Hotel. One of them is actually correct, but that is no matter, as the other is convinced that it is in fact a new addition to the real place. Good for bargaining though. I've got AC and a balcony for five bucks a night.

So I'm eating my Shawarma in the lobby, talking to the manager (who now claims that he used to manage the real Dahab and thus the misunderstanding) and his &quot;brother&quot;, and it turns out that there is a big wedding party tomorrow night and they need a huge favor, as the only place in town where you can get imported liquor is the duty free shop at the Sheraton. Of course they're lying, but I've been lied to all day and I'm used to it. And besides, what could possibly go wrong? 

As a newly arrived visitor, my passport is a valuable thing. It contains a dated stamp that entitles me to bring 3 liters of alcohol and 3 cartons of cigarettes into the country. I'm finally getting to repay karma for mooching off upperclassmen for all those beer runs back at school. I'm expecting to be handed some cash and a list, then be inserted quietly into the lobby and return a hero, but no. It's easier than that. All I gotta do is hang out while our brother goes shopping, then produce my passport at the proper moment. Kind of a let down.

Anyway, my services netted me a couple warm cans of beer to enjoy on the rooftop deck of the hotel. So much sweeter because of how they were earned. I woulda done it just for the story. 
BFE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             {{9|center}}
Last anybody heard from me, I was about to hop a bus out into the Libyan Desert in search of an Oasis or two. I'm happy to report that I survived the experience.

Farafra, [[L63]]. Aptly named, and about the second most remote place in the whole country. There's a little village, a couple springs, and a bit of irrigation to expand the stand of date palms surrounding it all. Apart from that, it's just sand as far as the eye can see, Lawrence of Arabia style. I blew a day there, hired a jeep to take me out into the desert to catch the sunset, then made my way to a hotspring in the middle of nowhere to relax and check out the stars. Yeah, this will do...

{{1184|right}}Next up was [[L5152]] and [[L1556]] for a bit of Tomb Raiding. Wow. Nothing I can say would do the place justice. If you've been there, you'll know. If not, you need to go before you die. Now is a great time to be in [[L63]]. With the combination of the off-season, the US government recommending its citizens to panic, and the resulting weak [[L63]]ian Pound, it's like a fire sale over here. You can rent a camel for $0.50 an hour!

I'm on the Sinai now, chillin' on the beach at Dahab, looking to do some diving, and maybe give some attention to my recently neglected suntan. My room costs $1.50 a night. I should be able to hold out about six years... 
Kester of Arabia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                {{1186|right}}I spent the last couple days trekking about in the desert at Wadi Rum and sleeping on the roof of the government resthouse. Even found and filled my water bottles at the spring that Lawrence used to use back in the day. Nice. The place was empty, too. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the US Government for continuing to issue terror warnings for every country that I visit. It really helps cut down on the crowds!

{{1187|center}}
{{1188|left}}Petra was just plain amazing. What a great idea! Giant buildings carved right out of the rock. Why didn't anybody else think of this? The place is still inhabited by the descendants of the people that have lived there since the day, but now they've got souvenier stands. It's great, you get your own little Bedoin kid following you around trying to sell you rocks. Already got some, kid. The place is made of rock. Want one out of my shoe?

I may spend a day down at the Dead Sea, then it's off into [[L211]] and certain death. Wish me luck! 
Livin' Large in the Axis of Evil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                So far, [[L211]] has not been quite as deadly as the State Department would have you believe. Mostly, it's just awesome! [[L5117]] is amazing. Best city in the mideast, as far as I'm concerned. You can really tell that it's the end of the Silk Road, the place where East meets West. It's still chock-full of typical arabs, with Arafat headdresses and ninja-gear women. But there's also quite a few women here who dare to dress western (a HUGE offence everywhere else in the mideast). And the busses here look like they came straight from [[L1804]], complete with chrome-plated everything and thousands of multicolored lights. In short, I'm sold on the place. I was planning to leave this morning, but I just couldn't drag myself away.

I think I'm going to give [[L129]] a miss. Too bad, since it probably would have been cool, but it's just so expensive to get there and back, since you have to buy a new [[L211]]n visa to return. And really, [[L5099]] is all about the nightclubs, and I'm not much for hitting them by myself. My hotel in [[L5117]] is really nice, and where just about all the backpackers stay. Unfortunately, at the moment it is devoid of &quot;lets go party in [[L5099]]&quot; hooligans to make the trip worthwhile.
Fourth of July                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  {{1192|left}}Not too much festivity here for the 4th. Though I did celebrate [[L38]] Day on the 1st. A group of Canadians showed up at the Pension in [[L5168]], complete with their own flag to hang above the pool.

I'm being shown around by a couple Turkish girls now, and try as I might, I just couldn't convey to them the concept of Independance day. [[L224]] has changed hands so many
times, and this last time it went in 4 stages, so the idea of a single day of liberation doesn't quite fly with them. They'd have a dozen days spread out over the year.

I'm on the beach at Olympos now, enjoying life in mediterrainean [[L3322]]. There's not much to do here, but that's not really the point. After a couple more days of this, I'm going to take a 4-day sailing trip along the coast to Oludinez &amp; [[L5170]].
Efe'd up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        {{1196|right}}[[L224]] y'alls! It's all good!

Just got off the boat from Olympos. 4 days of chilling in the sun, swimming in the Med., and sleeping on the deck of a beat up old yacht.

Ten passengers and a cheap price mean that they end up cutting corners in a lot of areas. The food was not particularly exciting, and they kept lopping off chunks of the itinerary. Twice a day, somebody would have the brochure out, reading about whatever secluded cove we were supposed to stop at but were at the moment sailing past. Lucky for me I had never read that brochure. No expectations = No disappointment.

{{1195|left}}But yeah, the ride was cool. Nothing to do but sip cold beers, work on the suntan, and maybe jump into the sea from time to time to cool off. Evidently, we cruised past some nice beaches and awe-inspiring ruins, but really I was too busy chilling to pay any attention.
Site up again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I'm in Istanbul now, staying at this hostel with an amazing 360 degree view. There's the bosporous close in on one side and the blue &amp; red mosques a block away on the other. All this for a mere (pause to bring Dr. Evil finger to lips...) Ten Million Lyra!

Istanbul is a great city. There's historic scenery everywhere, and shady parks as well. There is a Jazz festival going on, so a couple of us headed across town last night to catch this amazing quartet in an outdoor amphitheater.

In between the 6 and 12 hour bus rides to get here from [[L5170]], I spent a day at Ephesus checking out yet more spectacular ruins. I was amazed at how many people were there. Thousands. I have no idea where they dug all these people up. Maybe everybody who was planning to go to [[L63]] came to [[L224]] instead. 
Frogger!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        {{1183|left}}Crossing the street in this town, you need to be a bit more suicidal than normal. The streets are all 8 lanes wide, without any breaks in traffic and no crosswalks. Basically, you wait for enough room to step off the curb, then cast off and [[L5247]] for the best. The drivers don't actually accelerate when they see you coming, which at least gives you a fighting chance, but they still have a few tricks up their sleeves. Just this evening I was taken out by a taxi that was backing up a one-way street. Nice one, Mr. Taxi. I'll be watching for you next time.

These last few days, I've been soaking up the antiquities and trying to breach security at the US embassy so that I can get some more pages added to my passport. I've completely filled the thing. I win! Unfortunately, they're on double-secret terror alert here, so there's 200 troops outside the embassy and the streets are blocked off for a half dozen blocks in all directions. This is my second day of effort, I almost made it to the front door this time. I've got a good feeling about tomorrow. 
PBRs and Mini-corn dogs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         {{4|center}}
{{6|right}}Tonight, I'm drinking Johnia Waaker Black Label. No typos there, it's genuine egyptian whiskey. Aged almost six weeks. Tastes much like the local hootch in [[L215]].

I'm doing my rescue diver course at the moment. Underwater Combat would be a better title for this thing. For two days now, I've been trying to subdue panicked divers at the surface and below, while my mask is being pulled from my face, my regulator is being ripped from my mouth, and I'm being kicked and beaten about the head and neck by the thrashing scuba tank of my 250 pound instructor. Even when we're doing basic things like taking our gear off and on at the bottom, this guy will come up and turn your air off to see what you do. Too much fun! 

{{5|left}}One more day of this and I should be certified. After a bit of celebrating, I think I'll hop the ferry into [[L118]]. This place is great, but there's only so much relaxing a fella can do before it's time to move on.
The Second Lap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I'm at it again.

This time it's [[L215]], [[L128]], [[L39]] and parts north, but it really doesn't matter where. The important part is taken care of. I can already myself slipping into travel mode, where you can't control anything and it's no big deal. My bags didn't make it, and everything was closed when the cab dropped me off on Khoa San road at 3:30 this morning, but no worries. Life's about to get good, and small things like that don't seem to carry as much weight over here.

Besides, the best red curry in the world is only twenty paces away. I'm'a gonna get me some. 
Guy on the beach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I spent the better half of last week in a pitched battle for control of my belly. I escalated to antibiotics, and came out the victor. Got back on the rock yesterday and today I was finally starting to hit stride. Got a 7a and worked out a new sequence for a tough 7b that I squeaked by on last time I was here. That's .11d and .12b for the non-french.

But none of that will matter soon, as I am about to become a huge movie star in [[L215]]! I was sitting in a cafe on the beach, reading a book and toying with the remains of my pad thai this afternoon, when a couple thai girls came up and asked if I'd like to be in a ice cream commercial. But of course. Why else would I be waiting here? 

They took a bunch of photos and videotaped me walking up to the camera and smiling and talking about how much I enjoyed partying on the beach and eating ice cream. It was hilarious. Anyway, if I make the cut, they'll ship me and fifteen other superficial looking farang off to some beach in Trang provence for a week. There's even some baht in the deal. 

So yeah, that's my story for the day. I'll keep you posted on my soon to be illustrious career as an actor! 
book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The following is the contents of an email to our poor kid Ethan, who actually wanted to come out, but put too much faith in the motivation of his friends: 

As I can sense the impending weenie excuse, I'll leave you with a theory I've developed about travelling: Your friends don't actually want to go.

They'll say the do, and may even believe it themselves after enough talk and a few beers, but as the date draws near and it's time to drop real money on tickets, the excuses will inevitably come out. The only solution I've found is to always plan to go alone. Prepare for the off chance that maybe somebody will actually decide to come along for a while, but never count on it.

If you really want to go travelling, the best thing you can do is book a ticket today. That may actually spur one of these tossers off the fence, but that's not your concern. It is all good here. Get your ass on a plane. 
Re: Watch out for THE BIRDS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This was sent in response to one of the emails that I received from every man, woman and child in the [[L233]], warning me about the dreaded Bird Flu in [[L215]]:

They are running dangerously low on animals to eat over here. I hear kitten is nice. I'm actually all about the chickens these days. I figure after a month of dealing with the quality standards of a Thai kitchen, there is not much you could put in my stomach that it hasn't seen.

So I've been here a month, and I've seen a total of two places. My visa is about to expire, so I am now forced to do at least a nominal amount of travelling. It's off to Penang, [[L156]]. 
Still on the beach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So I blew through my 30 day visa without leaving the beach. I'll probably do the same with the new one too. Yessir, traveling far and wide these days.

Ok, I guess I did make it down to [[L156]] for a week, but really only to take care of the visa situation and eat a whole bunch of noodles in Chinatown. 

Stopped in Trang for a couple nights on the way back, and set off into the countryside on a rented motorbike. There are miles of beautiful white sand beach with basically no development at all, and no tourists except a few Thais. There's even nice rocks to be climbed, just like Railay but without the tourists. I may have to buy some land down there...

One of the beaches that I checked out is only accessable by walking through a cave. And not just one of those duck-under-these-few-rocks caves, but a full on better-have-a-second-light-source cave. With bats. 

On the way back, I got rained off the road and into a random little restaurant/shack, where I got to practice my Thai for a few hours with the locals. I still have a long way to go before I can master this language.

Climbing goes well. Flashed a .12a yesterday, just missed flashing another one today, then spent the morning falling off a .13a just for fun. 
Re: Work, hike, and Espanol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I'm still on Tonsai beach. Just paid for another month, in fact. Yesterday was a great day, as I finally got two hard routes that I had been working on for a while. One of the newly arrived portland people (there are 6 of us now) has a digital video camera, so I'll have a DVD full of climbing footage to show you all when I get home.
Here's me, Here's the bear...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   So I was mauled by a bear yesterday. Not a very big bear, and not much of a scratch even, but mauled is mauled. I'm sorta proud of myself. 

Me &amp; Jay rented motorbikes and headed off to this big waterfall out at the end of a dirt road. It's one of these multi-tiered limestone falls, with lots of pools to swim around in, ledges to jump from, and hidden grottoes behind curtains of water with ferns and moss and forest elves frolicking. A great addition to the end of any dusty dirt road. 

Anyway, the caretakers are also nursing back to health a few animals that were retrieved from poachers. There's a large enclosure full of bears, with a shack at one end containing some food and a tiny lady with a stick. If you drop some money in the donation box, she'll hand you a couple bananas and let you in to play with the bears. If they're not too busy fighting amongst themselves and behaving like wild animals, they'll hop up on their hind legs and walk over to take some food from your hand. And maybe take a swipe at you if you don't supply it promptly. 

There is also an enclosure with a large tiger inside that you can pet through the bars. I didn't try giving that lady any money. 
Cryin' into a bowl of noodles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Made it to [[L240]] in grand style. 20 hours with my knees in somebody's back, and to the outskirts of [[L2829]]. Sleep deprived and ill-fed as I may be, I do know that there's only one highway in [[L240]]. It goes through the center of every city. The bus driver has pitched our bags out the window exactly a mile short, in front of a group of greedy looking motorcycle taxi drivers.

I stumble forth with book in hand, pointing at a map and debating whether to walk, then do a quick inventory of things hanging from my person. Yessir, remember that little bag with everything valuable that I own...

There follows a loud stream of obscenity, a mad sprint towards the largest looking bike, and some completely unnecessary instructions to the driver as I hop on and we speed off into traffic. Lights are run, large trucks are passed in the gravel, certain death is narrowly avoided dozens of times, yet no large busses seem to be coming into view over the horizon. We give chase at top speed through town and for a full 10 kilometers into the countryside before giving up. 

I've already committed myself to the impossible task of contacting the hotel in [[L5081]] and somehow arranging to have the pack (which contains my laptop, incedentally) picked up on the other end. No [[L5247]] of course, but I tell the driver to turn us around. In doing so, we are nearly struck down by my bus, which we have somehow managed to pass on the way through town.

[[L2829]] is interesting, I doubt I'd recommend it to anybody. No tourists here, which amplifies the [[L240]]ese habit of staring at any westerners and following them around. I'm the only white guy in town at the moment, so I get all the attention. Hey everybody! Come look! He's eating noodles now!
several small bowls of good                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Made it to [[L5185]]. 

The food here rocks, as advertised. Good call to those who recommended this place. I was a bit doubtful about this country after [[L2829]] and the stare-fest of a reception I got. now that there's other mzungu around to share in the hassle, it's much easier. May stay a while. 
In search of the perfect seven dollar meal (continued)                                                                                                                                                                                                          I'm still in [[L5185]], halfway through my 30 day visa. It's just that pleasant here. Tonight, I had to avoid another incredible Vietnamese meal, if only to keep my sanity. The food is so good. The food is so cheap! I usually go for two appetizers, a main dish, and possibly a couple glasses of the local beer if they have it on tap. And I still have not broken five dollars! 

Went Indian tonight. It was good too, but I fear it will only send me back into the fried wontons and white rose with renewed vigor tomorrow. I may never escape this accursed town! 

So yeah, I've found the place in SE Asia that even my mother would enjoy. Clean, nice, four zillion tailors (I'm having a silk shirt made for $8, but only because I didn't bargain very hard.) Hot water, A/C if you want it, good coffee. Everything you could need, and cool spring weather to boot. Book a flight to Danang, and catch a shuttle on down. I'll probably still be here. 
Eatin' good in the neighborhood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I just had another fantastic meal in [[L240]]. The food here is SOOOO good! This one was slices of marinated, stirfried pork alongside little deep-fried packets of sticky rice wrapped in rice paper. Incredible. Throw in a plate of spring rolls and a half liter of tasty local beer, charge me four dollars, and I'm a happy man. 

[[L240]] is still groovy. Found a little roll-your-own springroll place on the street the other day, where they give you some wrappers, a bunch of mint leaves, and a giant platter of raw pork. I thought you were supposed to die if you ate uncooked pork, but the place was packed with locals and none of them seemed to care. Still alive, for the time being. 

I'm on the train to [[L44]] tomorrow night, for some climbing and chillin' in [[L5186]]. If it were up to me, I'd take the next 2 months to go through [[L44]] slowly, then maybe another month for [[L143]] and [[L191]]. Unfortunately, the [[L191]]ns are not too flexible with their visas. I committed to the dates thinking that 5 months in SE Asia would be plenty. It seems that no amount of time is ever quite enough. 
Re: Big Top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Made it to [[L5186]], but somehow I've not been all that motivated to climb. It seems like there are no climbers around. 

It's a strange place here. They really love tourism. Everything worth visiting has been developed in the Disneyland model. Bigger is better. Take a place with amazing views and natural splendor, then add roller-coasters and aerial tramways to make it even better. Most tourists are Chinese, in giant package groups. 

It's the Chinese labor holiday this week, so everybody is traveling to all the tourist sites. And when everybody in [[L44]] does something, it's quite a thing to see. [[L5186]] was pretty crowded when I first got here, but on the first it just went insane. You simply could not walk down the streets because the people were too thick. Hotel prices are tripled, you can't find an empty seat on a train, and even more tourists are flocking everything. It would be amusing if I wasn't in a hurry to get to [[L1342]]. As it is, I'm essentially trapped in the South for the next 7 days.
Peking Duck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I'm in [[L1342]] now, trying in vain to find a restaurant that will serve me some of that famous roast duck. Last night, I was drinking the good cheap local beer and and enjoying the conversation with a bunch of folks from the hostel. At about 4:15 am, somebody suggested that we should walk to Tienaman square to watch the amazing daily [[L3190]] flag raising ceremony. We barely made it there by 5:00, just in time. 

Not at all impressive. But it was nice to see the [[L3190]] over [[L1342]], and we found a good restaurant for a breakfast of steamed dumplings and wonton soup. I woke up at 4:30, and am just now getting started with my day. 
Another rant on Chinese tourism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [[L44]] loves its tourism. There is no natural wonder so beautiful that it could not be improved with the help of man. Say you have a really impressive cave with crazy rock formations. That's great and all, but what if you then built a 50 foot tall concrete butterfly over the entrance, added stairs up to it, widened all the passageways, lighted it, installed fountains, and piped in music. It also needs a karaoke bar. THEN, the tour busses will start showing up for real! 

There are no tranquil pools that you can sit by and think about life. They have tranquil pools of course, but they are surrounded by hotels, Ferris wheels, aerial tramways, and filled in with gravel so that they can be converted into a Hot Spring. 

[[L1342]] is cool though. It's big but not dense. I could deal with living here. Apart from that though, you'd really need to know Chinese well enough to find a remote village if you wanted to see [[L44]] in its unaltered version. 
Global Domination!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Yalp! I'm in [[L143]] now. Yeah that's right, freakin' [[L143]]! I've moved in with 5 armies, and I'm about to roll on into [[L2466]]. I should have all the green territories by the time I'm finished, and we all know that's 9 armies a turn. Let's see what your little exploits in North America pan out to. 

But for now, I'm swaddled in a crazy padded jacket that I bought out of a shipping crate of stolen Russian army gear. Tomorrow I'm off to the hills to live in a Ger and drink some fermented mare's milk. Tonight, I hit the town, Ulan Bataar style! 
Chillin' with Chingis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I spent the last 4 days wandering about in rural [[L143]], sleeping in a Ger just outside of Kharkhorim, which is the village that now stands where Karakorum used to be. Nothing is left of the old capital except a couple stone turtles that used to mark its boundaries. 

[[L143]] is really cool. It's like you took eastern Washington, made it 100 times as vast, covered it with a nice lawn and added Yaks. Not a fence to be seen outside of town, and not much in the way of towns. We drove for 8 hours and passed one village on the way east from Ulaan Baatar. 

My cyrillic skills are coming along, which in nice, otherwise I'd never find my way back to YnaaH baatap, or anybody to sell me some byy3 or xyywyyp for lunch. 

Tonight I hop the train North, so I'll be out of communication for at least a week. Got a pocket full of Roubles and a smile on my face. This should be good! 
The Trans-Siberian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Made it to [[L5038]] OK, and I'm enjoying the benefits of being back in Europe. That being, I'm typing from my laptop in a coffee shop in a mall under Red Square. 

The train was fun, though not quite the grand adventure it's made out to be. Mostly it was the easiest part of my trip thus far. Just hanging out in one place for 4 days and talking to people in German (nobody speaks english in [[L191]], but they usually understand some German.) Every few hours, you get to step out onto the platform for 15 minutes and buy more Piroshkis or sausages. Got two books read! 
St. Pete                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I'm in St Petersburg now. It's starting to grow on me, but my first impressions were not good. 

The train got in at 7am, and the hostel I wanted opens at 8, so I killed an hour walking along Nevsky Prospekt and checking out an old monastery. Fine so far, but the hostel turned out to be full. Went back to the train station where there is an internet caf&#233; and found and booked a different hostel. 

Walking out of the station I took a wrong turn and didn't realize it until I was a mile down the wrong road. Cut across town, managing to pass roughly every tourist site in town, and finally made it to where I wanted to be. Only to find that this hostel has no sign out front. And I didn't have the address written down. 

No phone number, no address, no sign. Three hours had passed by the time I made it back to the same internet caf&#233; and purchased another 5 minutes online and a pencil. 

Lucky for me, they actually honored my online reservation, so I'm sorted. I was close to booking a ticket to [[L5187]] for tonight. I figured I'd seen the whole town anyway, and clearly it didn't want me here. But life is good again. I think I'll go sleep away the afternoon. 
Waiting for Spring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Did [[L5187]] for a week, then bought a ScanRail pass and headed North in search of the midnight sun. Digging Scandinavia thus far, with one notable exception: 

Nobody drinks coffee in [[L73]]. At least they don't drink it in the morning when it makes sense. If you search far and wide you can find a coffee shop, but then it won't open until 10:30am. I can't see how these people survive. Had to leave. 

I'm in [[L2624]] now, about to catch up on much lost sleep. Did a night train from [[L5188]] to [[L1578]], then a day wandering around in search of said cuppacino, then straight onto the night ferry for [[L209]], with no cabins available. Got in to a hostel this morning, and ended up in a room with 5 loud italian guys who proceded to pack and talk for 2 hours. Yessir, sleep sounds good. 

The midnight sun was cool! 
Back in civilization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So I made it out of Asia, and am safely back on European soil. Things make sense here. People don't follow me down the streets and ask to take pictures. Police don't stop me every block and ask for my papers. Toilets can even flush toilet paper. I'm loving it! 

Everybody already knows everything about Europe, so I'll stop recording my progress at this point. I'm already running low on motivation to see any more cathedrals. I'll probably start looking for a flight home before the month is out. 

Anybody up for the Silk Roads next year? 
RE: mushroom Mushroom!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Dude. I'm running out of things to report over here. Somehow, the fact that I'm still here doing the same stuff as last month does not seem all that newsworthy. I am, however, consistently onsighting .12a, so I guess that's nice.

Me and Jay rented motorbikes the other day and went tearing around the county. It was awesome, and hardly disastrous at all. Jay only made it over the handlebars once, and not even into traffic. I'll certainly be back for more. 
Re: Haven't heard from you for awhile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I've been to [[L156]] again for visa run #2. On the way back, I spent another couple nights in Trang and explored some more of the surrounding area on a rented motorscooter. This time, I made it way down some dirt road and stopped to watch this cool Thai Eagle (like a slightly smaller bald eagle, but brown instead of black), when up scoots a local, shouting greetings. We talked a minute, and he invited me back to his home for lunch. 

I followed him down an ever-crazier series of dirt roads, cart tracks, footpaths, and jungle trails until we finally came into a clearing with a couple shacks on stilts and an overview of some ponds and mangroves. By the time I had the Thai dictionary out and found myself a place on the floor of the hut, all the neighbor kids had come running up and were standing in a bunch by the door, staring and giggling. I tried out my Thai &quot;Ben dtek Thai chop farang (thai kids like barbarians).&quot; with much success. Got a tasty meal and some good Thai practice before motorscooting onward to go swimming at an empty beach.

And for the record, these were in fact the dreaded Southern [[L215]] Muslims, though none to separatist nor fanatical at the moment. Just to tempt fate a bit more, I put in a good attempt to handle one of their chickens.

Two days ago, four of us went up Ao Nang tower, this big spire of rock sticking out of the sea. You get there by hiring a boat to the tower and stepping off the bow onto a ledge at the base of the route. The route is 80 meters long, and you do it in three pitches, with lots of scary moves on overhanging rock with a very pronounced feeling of exposure. Getting down is the fun part. You flag down a passing boatman, then rappel the final 50 meters into the boat. Even better, since the boat drifts away a bit during the time it takes to lower, and you are the only thing it's tied to, you end up rapping down over the open ocean until you can just dip a toe into it. Then the boatman reels you and the boat together and pulls you aboard. Too much fun!

I may be moving on to [[L128]] before too long. 
Installing the engine and more                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In early 2004, I installed the engine and transmission.  
{{134|center}}
I also installed custom-made brake lines and tailpipes.
{{135|center}}
... and mufflers, fuel pump, trans cooler, and horns.
{{139|center}}
Body on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Almost ready for the body.
{{137|center}}
We had a party to put the body on the frame. 
{{148|center}}
Then I put in the gas tank and battery tray.
{{138|center}}
New instruments.  
{{145|center}}
New wiring, dash and package tray..
{{152|center}}
Radiator and grill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Installed the fan and alternator.
{{141|center}}

and the radiator.
{{151|center}}

and channeled the grill.
{{146|center}}

Looking pretty good.
{{142|center}}
In the beginning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Okay, so this isn't really a trip report.  However, it definitely is an adventure.

Bought the Roadster in Sept of 2003.  Pretty straight.  Just frame and body.

Needed to get it to our Winter home in [[L3013]], so loaded it into a rental truck.
{{154|center}}
I first worked on the body a bit. I chopped the windshield and leaned it back.
{{147|center}}
Florence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        We stayed outside [[L5124]] in a small town on the hill called Fiesole.{{160|center}}

Our plan was to take the bus into [[L5124]].  Alas, they were having a one day bus strike, so we drove in and parked illegally in the town.
{{161|center}}

We climbed the doma in the church.
{{162|center}}
Pretty tight as you get to the top.
{{163|center}}
But, the view is worth the effort.
{{164|center}}

We also went to several museums.  The most interesting was the Museum of Science.
{{165|center}}
One room is filled with a giant model of the galaxy, with all the orbs rotating around the earth.

Rome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            We turned in the car, and spent 3 days in Rome.  We had to see the Colliseum.
{{170|center}}
{{171|center}}
And Trivoli Fountain.
{{173|center}}
And the Vatican.
{{174|center}}
And the Spanish Steps.
{{172|center}}

We then hopped on a train bound for [[L5080]].
{{175|center}}
Venice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We took the water ferry to our hotel.
{{179|center}}
Bridge with shops.
{{177|center}}
Gondola.
{{176|center}}
[[L1365]] museum.
{{178|center}}
St Marks Square.
{{180|center}}

If we had to do it over, we'd start in [[L5080]].  Lots to see, and you need to do most on foot. Better to do it before [[L5056]].
All good thus far                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               So I'm back in [[L5097]], at the tail end of a one-way ticket.  Things are essentially going according to plan, with minor exceptions such as the part where EVA Airlines wouldn't let me on the plane until I shelled out $950 for a return ticket.  Tomorrow will be day two of the grand &quot;refund the expensive yet worthless return ticket&quot; adventure.

But hey, I got to watch the sun rising over Mt [[L2101]] this morning, and my favorite curry stall is still where I left it.  We'll call it good...
